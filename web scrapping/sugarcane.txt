Expert System for Sugarcane Expert System For Sugarcane Home | About Us | Contact Us Categories Botany & Climate Season & Varieties Nursery Management Cultivation Practices Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative Irrigation Management Nutrient Management Crop Protection Farm Implements Post Harvest Technology Marketing Institutions & Schemes FAQ's Related Links Botany And Climate About Sugarcane Vernacular Names Origin Introduction Botanical description Climate Vernacular Names English: Cultivated Sugarcane, Noble Cane, Noble Sugarcane, Sugar Cane. Hindi: Ganna, Sakhara, Ukh. Tamil: karumbu Malayalam: Karimbu, Karimpu Kannadam: kabbu Top of page Origin Sugarcane originated in New Guinea where it has been known since about 6000 BC.The cultivated canes belong to two main groups: (a) thin, hardy north Indian types S.barberi and the Chinese S.sinenses and (b) thick, juicy noble canes S.officinarum. Highly prized cane is S.officinarum. The origin of S.officinarum is the Indo-Myanmar China border with New Guinea as the main centre of diversity. The officinarums are called the "noble canes' due to thick, juicy, low-fibred canes of high sucrose content. The origin of S.robustum is New Guinea. The origin of S.spontaneum is subtropical India. The habitat of these two wild canes is swamps, river banks, water courses etc. Tropical cane (Thick cane) might have originated in New Guinea. From India it spreads probably to China, Arabia, Egypt and Sicily. Top of page Introduction Sugarcane and sugarbeet are the main sources of sugar in the world. Out of total sugar produced in the world 60 per cent is obtained only from sugarcane. Asia is the largest producer of sugar followed by Europe Most of the sugar in Asia comes from sugarcane whereas in Europe from sugarbeet. Presently sugarcane is grown in an area of 16 m. ha in over 79 countries. The global production of raw sugar is 112 m.t. India stands first in area (3.93 m. ha) and production (167 m.t) among the sugarcane growing countries of the world. Uttar Pradesh has the largest area almost 50 per cent of the cane area in the country, followed by Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Haryana and Punjab. These nine are most important sugarcane producing states. Sugarcane production is also highest in U.P. followed by Maharashtra. Productivity wise, Tamilnadu stands first with over 100 tonnes per hectare followed by Karnataka, Maharashtra. Bihar has the lowest productivity amount the major sugarcane growing states. The sugar industry is the second largest agro-based industry, next only to textiles, in the country. Top of page Classification of Sugarcane Family - Gramineae Class - Monocotyledons Order - Glumaceae Sub family - Panicoidae Tribe - Andripogoneae Sub-tribe - Saccharininea Top of page Botanical Description Sugarcane is a tall perennial tropical grass, which tillers at the base to produce unbranched stems from 2-8 m more tall, and to around 5cm in diameter; it could be called as giant grass. It is cultivated for these thick stems or stalks or canes, from which the sugar is extracted. The botany of cane consists of root, leaves, stem and inflorescences. Root Stem Leaf Inflorescence Root The root system is fibrous and in two types namely ‘sett roots’ and ‘shoot roots’. When the sugarcane sett is planted in the soil, the root primordial situated at the base of every cane joint is activated and produces roots. These roots are ‘sett roots’ and are mostly temporary. Sett roots can emerge within 24 hours of planting. The shoot roots arise from the root rings of the lower nodes of tillers. These roots are thick, fleshy, white and less branched. These are permanent roots which are continually produced from tillers. Shoot root emerges from the base of the new shoot 5 -7 days after planting. Top of page Stem Sugarcane is propagated vegetatively from stem cuttings. The stem of sugarcane is roughly cylindrical and consists of nodes and internodes, the former being the area around the bud from the leaf scar to the growth ring and the later being the part between two nodes. The node consists of a lateral bud, root primordia and growth ring. Bud situated in the axil of the leaf on alternate sides of the stalk. Root primordia at lower side of the leaf scar arranged in rows. Growth ring present immediately above the each node, coated with waxy layer. The top of the stem is poor in sucrose and is of little value to the sugar factory. Top of page Leaf The leaf consists of two parts, the blade and the sheath, separated by a leaf joint. The leaves are attached alternately to the nodes. The leaf sheath is tubular in shape and is inserted at the node. The leaf blade is linear or lanceolate reaching one to one and midrib is prominent with groove on upper surface. The ligule is a membranous ring found as an appendage of the sheath, separating the latter from the blade, and bears long hairs. The scarious extension of the leaf sheath is know as auricles. Top of page Inflorescence The inflorescence or tassel of sugarcane, generally called as ‘Arrow’ is a loose terminal panicle. 25-50 cm long arrow with silky appearance owing to rings of long hairs below each spikelet. The arrangement of the spikelet is racemose. Each tassel consist of several thousand tiny flowers, each capable of producing one seed. Sugarcane usually flowers at the age of 10-12 months but some varieties do not flower at all. Top of page Climate Sugarcane is a tropical plant. It grows more successfully in those regions where the climate is more or less tropical but it can grow in sub tropics too as in north India. Sugarcane is grown in the world from altitude 35° N and 35° S, from sea level to 1000m of altitude or little more. Climatic factor Latitude and altitude: Sugarcane is grown in the world from altitude 36.7° N and 31.0° S, from sea level to 1000m of altitude or little more. Rainfall: A total rainfall between 1100 and 1500 mm is adequate provided the distribution is right, abundant in the months of vegetative growth followed by a dry period for ripening. It also grown in area where rainfall is low upto 500 mm. Above 1500 mm rainfall cause lodging of cane. Temperature: Growth is closely related to temperature. It has a wide temperature range from over 38°c. Optimum temperature for cane growth (germination) is 27° to 33°c (80 to 90°F). Temperature below 27°c definitely injurious to the cane, reduce tillers and above 38°c adversely affect the sprouting. Ideal temperature: Carbon assimilation-30°c Sugar synthesis-30°c Sugar transport- 30-35°c Tillering-33.3-34.4°c Root growth- 36°c Shoot growth- 33°c Relative humidity: High humidity (80-85%) favours rapid cane elongation during grand growth period. A moderate value of 45-65% coupled with limited water supply is favourable during the ripening phase. Above 40% humidity coupled with warm weather favours vegetative growth of cane. Sunshine: Sugarcane is a sun loving plant. Greater incident radiation favours higher sugar yields. About 7-9 hr of bright sunshine is highly useful for both active growth and ripening. Frost: Sever cold weather inhibits bud sprouting in ratoons and arrest cane growth. At temperature -1°c to 2°c the cane leaves and meristem tissues are killed. Wind: High velocity winds exceeding 60 km/hr are harmful to grown up canes leading to lodging and cane breakage.

The seed plots should be distributed in different divisions or sections and accessible for easy distribution. There should be good road facility for easy and quick transport. The farmers should be progressive. Primary nurseries should be located in the factory farm/research station farm/Government seed farm. Top of page Soil preparations Ploughing and cultivation is essential so that a good seed bed is prepared. A higher amount of organic manures is advantageous for nursery crops for obtaining a vigorous crop. Apply 25 to 30 tonnes of FYM or cured press mud may be applied about 15 days before planting. Spacing To get a higher yield of setts a slightly narrower spacing is advantageous. Space should be75cm between the rows. Top of page Sett treatment a. Preparation of setts for planting: Take seed material from short crop (6 to 7 months age) free from pests and diseases incidence. Harvest the seed crop one day before planting to obtain higher percentage and uniform germination. Detrash the cane with hand before setts preparation. Avoid damage to buds while cutting setts. Planting material or seed cane should be free from aerial roots and splits. Change the seed material after every two to three seasons. In case if it is inevitable to use mature cane as seed, the top one-third portion can be used satisfactorily. b. Sett treatment with Azospirillum: Prepare the slurry with 10 packets (2000 g/ha) of Azospirillum inoculum with sufficient water and soak the setts in the slurry for 15 minutes before planting. c. Sett treatment with fungicide: The setts should be soaked in Carbendazim (1 gram in 1litre of water) d. Aerated steam treatment: Treat setts with Aerated steam at 50 o C for one hour to control primary infection of grassy shoot disease. Before planting setts 1. Use short crop (6-8 months) seed materials 2. Discard pest, disease affected and damaged buds and canes. 3. Do not trash & prop. 4. Apply 125 kg Urea / ha + 125 kg MOP/ha one month prior to harvest 5. Irrigate the crop well before harvest 6. Detrash the cane with hand at the time of sett preparation 7. Selection of proper planting months for raising nursery crop in relation to main field planting. Top of page Raise six to seven months old nursery crop prior to main field planting as follows: Raise nursery crop during Main field planting June December - January (early season) July February - March (Mid season) August April - May (Late season) Dec – Apr June - September (Special season) Polybag nursery Generally sugarcane is grown by planting the seeds setts directly into the field. But some times, when the water is in short supply or the field is occupied with some other crop, buds or seed setts can be planted in polythene bags to raise nursery. Polythene bags of 10x15cm filled with soil and compost mixture (in 1:1 ratio) are arranged closely in an open space, close to water source. Scooped buds are at 1-2 cm depth. Cut sugarcane pieces with one bud can also be used for raising the nursery. Insert these cut pieces into the soil, filled bags up to the node level, keeping buds just touching the soil. Irrigate these bags twice a week. Saplings will be ready for planting in 60 days. Top of page Copyright © TNAU | All Rights Reserved

Plough the field for 2 to 4 times at the depth of 50-60 cm with tractor drawn disc plough or victory plough. Top of page Harrowing It is the secondary tillage operation in sugarcane cultivation which pulverizes, smoothens and compact the soil to conserve the moisture. Harrowing is done at shallow depth of 12-15 cm to crush the clods by disc harrow or rotavator Top of page Levelling To ensure a uniform crop stand levelling is important also for easy movement of irrigation water. Levelling can be carried out using a tractor operated leveller. Top of page Lay out of field Irrigation – cum – drainage channels along and across the slope of the field at 10-15m intervals. Top of page Basal Application of organic manure and fertilizer Apply FYM at 12.5 t/ha or compost 25 t/ha or filter press mud at 37.5 t/ha before the last ploughing. Apply compost from sugarcane trash and pressmud @ 1:1 ratio.(sugarcane trash-15cm thickness,pressmud-5cm thickness, rock phosphate, gypsum and urea in the ratio of 2:2:1,cow dung slurry or water for moisture, ready to use after 3months). Test the soil and apply P fertilizer based on soil test values. Otherwise apply super phosphate (37.5 kg/ha) along the furrows and incorporate with hand hoe. Apply 37.5 kg Zinc sulphate/ha and 100 kg Ferrous sulphate/ha to zinc and iron deficient soils. Main field preparation and transplanting The mainfield preparation is done as usual. Basal manures are applied in the furrow in band or if labour is available, by digging a pit at the site of transplanting. The furrow is irrigated. The nursery bed should be well soaked so that the settlings could be easily removed without much damage to the root system. They are then transplanted in the furrow following 30-45 cm spacing. An additional line may be planted in every 10th row as material for gap filling. The life irrigation is given on 3rd or 4th day. After 10-15 days, the gap filling is done using the setllings planted on the 10th row. This technique may not be suitable during dry weather. Proper irrigation management till setllings establish is very important. Top of page Intercultural Operations Trash mulching Raising inter crops Crop rotation Gap filling Earthing up Control / Regulation of flowering in sugarcane Detrashing Propping Removal of water shoots Covering the field with green leaf manure plants Trash mulching Mulch the ridges uniformly with cane trash to a thickness of 10 cm within a week after planting. It helps to tide over drought, conserves moisture, reduce weed population and minimise shoot borer incidence. Mulch the field with trash after 21 days of planting in heavy soil and wetland conditions. Avoid trash mulching in areas where incidence of termites is noticed. Raising inter crops Tamilnadu Areas of adequate irrigation, sow one row of soybean or blackgram or greengram along the centre of the ridge on the 3rd day of planting. Intercropping of daincha or sunhemp along ridges and incorporation of the same on the 45th day during partial earthing up helps to increase the soil fertility, and also the cane yield. Especially Intercropping of Co.1 Soybean gives a yield of 800 kg/ha without any adverse effect on cane yield. Kerala Intercropping with short duration pulse crop. Karnataka They sow groundnut and pulse as inter crop with sugarcane. Crop rotation Sugarcane is generally grown after the harvest of cotton, rice, maize, toria, potato, wheat, etc. In sequence under 2 to 3 years rotation. Gap filling Fill the gaps, if any, within 30 days after planting with sprouted setts. Maintain adequate moisture for 3 weeks for proper establishment of the sprouted setts. Earthing up Earthing-up operation is also known as "hilling-up". This operation is carried out in two or three stages. The first earthing-up operation is known “partial earthing-up” and the second/third operation is known as "full earthing-up". The partial earthing-up is done at 45 days after planting. In partial earthing-up, little amount of soil from either side of the furrow is taken and placed around the base of the shoots. Full earthing-up is done after 120 days after planting coinciding with the peak tiller population stage. During full earthing-up the soil from the ridge in between is fully removed and placed near the cane on either side. This operation converts the furrows into ridges and ridges into furrows. This operation could be done either manually or by using a bullock-drawn/tractor drawn furrower depending upon the spacing adopted. After application of 3rd dose fertilizer (90 days), work victory plough along the ridges for efficient and economical earthing up. At 150 days after planting, earthing up may be done with spade. Control / Regulation of flowering in sugarcane Ethephon (ethrel) applied at the rate of 500 ppm effectively controlled flowering in a number of profuse flowering varieties. By altering the planting date, flowering can be avoided in heavy flowering areas. Adsali planting or special season planting (July to September) helps in avoiding flowering and its adverse effects. Non-flowering varieties are Co 8021, Co 86032, Co 87025, Co 91010, Co 94005 and Co 94008. Detrashing Detrashing refers to removal of unwanted bottom dry and green leaves at regular intervals. Sugarcane stalk bears large number of leaves (30-35) equal to the number of inter-nodes under good management systems. Detrashing should be taken up after the cane formation around 150 days after planting. There after it could be done at bi-monthly interval depending up on the labour availability. Propping The operation of tying the leaves together using the bottom dry and green leaves is known as propping. It is primarily done to avoid lodging of cane. Propping can be either done for each row or two rows can be brought together and tied. It is done at the age of 210 days of the crop Removal of water shoots Water shoots are late formed tillers or side shoots, which are robust and fast growing. They originate mainly due to excess water supply, heavy and late manuring, inadequate earthing up. Water shoots contain lot of water, low sucrose and more of reducing sugars. Water shoots affects the growth of adjacent statics. Therefore removal of water shoots whenever they appear is highly essential. Water shoots can be used as cattle feed. Covering the field with green leaf manure plants There is a practice of spreading lightly one to two tonnes of green wild indigo plants per acre over the entire planted fields immediately after the planting. When this is done, the evaporation of moisture from the recently planted fields is controlled to some extent and it will be possible to prolong the interval between irrigation. Subsequently the green matter can be incorporated in the soil. Top of page Method of Planting Planting in flat beds Low rainfall areas generally optimum for this planting method, which is simplest as well as cheapest of all. Shallow furrows( 8-10 cm deep) are opened with a local plough or cultivator at a distance of 75 – 90 cm. There should be adequate moisture in the field at the time of planting and two blind hoeings are given to replace the insect damaged setts. Setts are planted at end to end taking care that one three budded sett falls in each running 30 cm length of furrow. After germination, two to five inter row cultivation may be given at proper intervals to control the weeds and to facilitate the tillering. Generally, earthing is not done but some times, if it is necessary the crop may be given one earthing during July-August to protect the crop from lodging and to provide drainage in the field. Ridge and furrow method The method is generally adopted in areas with moderate rainfall but have drainage problems. The furrows are made in ‘v’ shape about 80-100 cm. Apart and about 20-25 cm deep. The setts are placed in horizontal position, usually in end-to-end system but if the seed stalk is not good and inter-nodes are longer eye-to-eye system of planting setts may be done. To minimize the border effects of gaps, doubling of setts is done at the ends of the furrows. As the canes start growing, the furrows are partly filled with soil and inter-row cultivation is carried out. This repeated inter-row cultivation results in leveling of the land by end of May or Mid of June which is called as first earthing. Further repetition of inter-row cultivation transforms the furrow into ridges by putting soil around the plants and inter-row space become furrow automatically, through which irrigation or drainage is provided. This transformation of furrows into ridges is called as second earthing. Pit method of sugarcane under drip fertigation system Pit to pit spacing- 1.5x1.5 m Number of pits/ha- 4,444 pits Pit diameter – 0.9 to 1.2 m Pit depth – 0.38 to 0.45m Number of budded setts / pit – 32 (Single budded setts) or 16 number of single budded setts. Fill the pits to a depth of 15 cm with compost and native soil and mix it well. Place the healthy setts in circular fashion leaving 10 cm from the outer boundary of the pits with equal spacing between each setts and cover the setts with the soil. On 50 to 60 days after planting give partial earthing up by sliding the soil from the outer boundary of the pit and full earthing up should be given leaving a depression of 2.5 cm from the ground level at 90 to 100 days after planting. Fertilizer dose- 275:62.5:112.5 kg NPK/ha The entire phosphorous dose can be applied as basal at the time of planting. The nitrogen and potassium as urea and MOP (White potash) should be applied through fertigation system in 14 equal splits starting from 15 DAP upto 210 DAP Drip design- lateral to lateral spacing 3.0 m (alternate rows) 8 mm micro tubes on either side of the lateral to a length of 1.0 m with one 8 LPH Irrigation – daily or in alternative days Wider or dual row planting To facilitate mechanisation in sugarcane cultivation, wide row planting adopting a spacing of 150 cm is becoming popular. Further improve the cane yield under wide rows, a new technology, ‘dual row planting’ has been developed. Broad furrows are formed at a spacing of 150 cm and in the middle of the furrows sugarcane setts are planted in two rows adopting a spacing of 30 cm between them. In a comparative study of two different methods of wide row planting, the dual row system gave a cane yield of 136.3 t/ha compared to 126.7 t/ha recorded by the single row system. In plant crop, variety Co 94005 recorded the highest cane yield under dual row planting. Among the spacing, the dual row planting and the normal 90 cm were on par and were significantly better than the other spacing. In the ratoon crop, variety Co 94005 was best for wide row spacing followed by Co 91010. Spaced transplanting (STP) method with single eye set Recently in STP (Spaced transplanting) method single eyed sets are used for planting. Either direct sets or seedlings raised in polybag nurseries are transplanted into the field after 50-55 days. For this STP or single eyed set method 750-1MT seed per acre is required. For both furrow and flat method rows are made 90cm apart and settlings are spaced at 45 – 90cm. If any settlings fails to establish it is required to replace by the extra stock maintain in the nursery This method saves seed cost by 60-70%. In this method distance between two sets kept at 30cm. Poly bag seedling transplanting This technique is also more or less same as STP technique. Here the seedlings are raised in perforater plastic bags of size 10x15 cm filled with FYM or pressmud, soil and sand 1:1:1 proportion. In this technique field establishment of seedlings is better, around 95-99%, as there is no damage to the root system. In this method, a small pit is dug out at specified spacing (45cm). A small quantity of phosphatic fertilizer is placed and covered with some soil. Then the settling is planted after clipping the green leaves. 'Chip-bud' or 'bud-chip' technique In this technique the bud along with a portion of the nodal region is chipped off using a bud chipping machine. The bud chips are treated with fungicide and planted in the raised bed nursery or in polythene bags filled with FYM/press mud, soil and sand in 1:1:1 proportion. Seedlings are transplanted as in case of STP technique. The advantages are that the quantity of seed material (chip buds) required is only around 1 to 1.5 tonnes and the cane after taking chips can be sent for milling. Tissue culture Micropropagation of seed cane through Tissue Culture technology is useful in developing large scale production of true to type and disease free sugarcane plantlets using apical meristem culture technique.faster multiplication of a sugarcane variety can be done. Apical meristem (growing part of sugarcane) is dissected and inoculated on a growth medium having definite nutrient composition. The apical meristem starts producing tillers in the laboratory after about 45 days of incubation in temperature and light controlled conditions. one apical meristem one can develop millions of plantlets in a period of seven to eight months. The plantlets well established and hardened in plastic bags are transplanted to field condition. Apply 16.5 Kgs. of granular lindane per hectare in the soil after fifteen days of transplantation and irrigate the field. This helps in preventing early shoot borer infestation. If necessary main shoot may be removed 35-40 days after transplanting. The major earthing up needs to be done at 90-100 days after transplanting. A seed multiplication ratio of 1:25 (planting material for 25 hectares is obtained from one hectare seed nursery) is obtained from the seed nursery planted with tissue culture plantlets. The well hardened plantlets developed when used give 98 to 100 % survival under field condition. Other Planting Methods Other planting methods 1. Sablang or sprouting Method Plants are grown in fertile soil with wide spacing, shallow planting, frequent irrigation, and adequate fertilization. The tillers are removed carefully from the mother plant as soon as they develop their own roots and are transplanted in the main field. The mother plant continues tillering and the tillers are planted in the main field in the same manner. 2. Rayungan Method Seed stalks are decaptivated (topped off) about 4-6 weeks before planting time. As a consequence, lateral shoots develop into tailed Rayungan which are cut off and planted out in the trenches made ready for the purpose. Thus by removing the upper rayungans, the lower buds also sprout which are similarly used. 3. Distance Planting In this method the top setts are collected and put in nursery and after they sprout and roots come out, they are transplanted in the main field at a spacing of 90 cm x 50 cm. 4. Tjeblock Method Tjeblock is an improvement over the Rayungan method because it takes care of proper availability of nutrients and energy to all the buds where as in Rayungan method, there is considerable stress on nutrients supply on lower buds. In Tjeblock method the stalk is cut off at its half length and planted vertically with one node under the soil for rooting. The planted ones and mother stalks are adequately irrigated and fertilized. Top of page Weed Management Introduction In India, sugarcane is planted in spring (February-March), autumn (September-October) and adsaliplanting (July-August). Being a long duration crop, it is heavily infested with a variety of weeds. Nearly 150 weed species including manuals, perennials and parasitic have been observed in sugarcane fields in different parts of India. The weed flora differs from location to location due to variation in agro-ecological conditions and management practices. Major weed flora observed in sugarcane fields are: Sedges- Cyprus rotundus Grasses-Cynodon dactylon, Sorghum helepense, Panicum spp, Dactylocternium aegyptium, the cogan grass Imperata cylindrica Broad leaved weeds – Striga asiatica, Chenapodium album, Convolvulus arvensis L., Amaranthus viridis L., Portulaca oleraceae L., Commelina bengalensis L., Trianthema portulacastrum L. Critical period of crop-weed competition Critical period can be defined, as “the shortest span of time in the ontogeny of crop growth when weeding will result in higher economic returns”. Sugarcane being initially slow-growing crop faces an acute competition from weeds. In sugarcane, weed infestation during 60-120 days after planting has been found detrimental for the final crop yield. In ratoon crop, critical period of crop-weed competition has been identified as 30-50 days after ratoon initiation. The losses due to weeds comprise Direct yield losses resulting from competition, Indirect losses from reduced crop quality, Increased costs in harvesting, land preparation and similar operations, and Harbouring insects’ pests and diseases. Besides, weeds remove large amount of nutrients from soil. Direct yield losses ranged from 11-74% depending upon the nature and intensity of weed flora and period of occurrence of weeds. The loss is mainly due to restriction of tiller production. Removing weed at any time during growing season may not be beneficial. It is necessary to identify critical period of crop-weed competition to render weed control practices more effective. Method of weed control Mechanical method Cultural Method Crop rotation Intercropping Trash mulching Chemical Method Mechanical Method Since sugarcane rows are widely spaced, shallow-rooted weeds can be managed by hoeing with hand tools or with intercultural operations during growing season of crop. Generally, 3-4 hoeing are required after every irrigation during tillering phase of crop to check crop-weed competition. The removal of weeds by mechanical means is laborious and expensive, and weeds in intra-row spaces are not killed. Besides, sometimes due to unfavourable weather/soil conditions, mechanical weeding may not be possible. Cultural method Crop rotation. Certain weeds have association with sugarcane crop and hence, monocropping of sugarcane may lead to severe crop-weed competition. Inclusions of green manure crops or fodder crops like sorghum not only suppress weeds but also help in crop diversification. Intercropping. Sugarcane is planted in wider-row spacing. This provides better opportunity for weeds to emerge in a large numbers and infest crop. Inclusion of short duration and quick growing intercrops in these row spaces can suppress weed growth to a great extent. Inter-row crops like mustard, potato or wheat in autumn and blackgram, greengram or cowpea in spring planted sugarcane have been found quite effective in weed suppression and higher cane yields. Trash mulching. In this, soon after emergence of cane trash covers of about 10-12 cm thickness should be provided in between cane rows. Trash cover restricts sunlight and checks weed emergence. Besides, suppressing weeds, trash mulching also conserves soil moisture, and provides a potential source of organic matter. Chemical method Generally, application of single herbicide may not be effective in controlling weeds in sugarcane because of a great diversity in weed flora and a longer duration required to suppress the weeds which come in several flushes. Pre-emergence application of simazine or atrazine at 1.5-2.0 kg/ha or metribuzine at 1.0 kg/ha or diuron at 2.5-3.0 kg/ha or ametryn at 2.0 kg/ha each followed by 2, 4-D at 0.75-1.0 kg/ha as post-effective for broad-spectrum weed control in sugarcane. Management of parasitic weed striga in sugarcane Striga is a becoming a major problem in sugaracane of Tamil Nadu and many other sugarcane growing areas of the country. Striga removes nutrients and extracts water from the sugarcane plant and causes heavy loss in cane productivity and quality. Intercropping with legumes such as soybean, cowpea or groundnut within the sugarcane rows row can significantly reduce the number of Striga coming to maturity. Plants which are pulled, within 2-3 weeks of the start of flowering, should be taken out of the field and burned so that seeds are not produced and shed from the drying plants. Where it is available and feasible or the farmer, the herbicide 2,4-D can be used before Striga flowering, as an alternative to hand-pulling but it may need to be repeated. trash mulching at 5.0 tonnes/ha at 90 days after planting has been found effective in reducing the density and dry weight of Striga. Pre-emergence application of atrazine at 1.0 kg/ha + 1 hand weeding at 45 days after planting with an earthing up at 60 days after planting combine with post-emergence application of 2,4-D Na salt at 5 g/l (0.50%) + urea 20 g/l (2%) at 90 days after planting has been recommended for effective control of Striga in sugarcane. Integrated weed management Being a long duration and widely spaced crop, there is an ample scope of using cultural/mechanical and chemical methods in combination so as to reduce dependence on either of the methods. In planted and ratoon crops, trash mulching followed by post-emergence application of herbicides has been found effective. Combination of pre-emergence herbicides, viz atrazine or metribuzine and intercultural operations has been found effective and economical. Irrigation at 40-45 DAP followed by hoeing and application of atrazine at 2.0 kg/ha or metribuzine at 1.0 kg/ha and 2,4-D at 0.50 kg/ha have been found effective and economical. Weed management in pure crop of sugarcane Spray Atrazine 2 kg or Oxyflurofen 750 ml/ha mixed in 500 lit of water as pre emergence herbicide on the 3rd day of planting. For post-emergence spray of Grammaxone 1.5 litre + 2,4-D sodium salt 2.5 kg/ha in 500 litre of water on 21st day of planting. If the parasitic weed striga is a problem, post-emergence application of 2,4-D sodium salt @ 1.25 kg/ha in 500 litre of water/ha may be done. 2, 4-D spraying should be avoided when neighboring crop is cotton or bhendi. Apply 20% urea also for the control of striga as direct spray. Pre- plant application of glyphosate at 2.0 kg ha-1 along with 2% ammonium sulphate at 21 days before planting of sugarcane. If herbicide is not applied work the junior-hoe along the ridges on 25, 55 and 85 days after planting for removal of weeds and proper stirring. Remove the weeds along the furrows with hand hoe. Otherwise operate power tiller fitted with tynes for intercultivation. Weed management in ratoon crop Weed management in sugarcane ratoon crop, the maximum cane yield could be obtained by three hoeing at 30, 60 and 90 days after harvest or spray atrazine 2.0 kg/ha as pre-emergence followed by 2,4-D at 1.25 kg/ha as post-emergence at 90 days after harvesting followed by directed spraying of glyphosate 1.0 kg/ha at 150 days after harvesting. Weed management in Sugarcane intercropping system Premergence application of Thiobencarb @ 1.25 kg a.i / ha under intercropping system in sugarcane which gives effective weed control. Pre-Emergence weed management: Protect the sugarcane crop without weeds for 90 days from planting onwards. During 3rd or 4th day after planting spray Atrazine @ 2.5 kg/ha uniformly on the surface of field before the emergence of weeds. Chemical should be diluted in 1000liter of water and spray through hand sprayer. Separate hand sprayer and nossel should be used for herbicide application. Before application of fertilizer, weeds which are not controlled by herbicide application should be uprooted by hand weeding. By this method we can reduce the maximum level of crop damage. Post-Emergence weed management: After the emergence of weeds, spray 2-4-D @ 2.5kg/ha to control broad leaves weed. Grass sp are controlled by hand weeding. Spraying of Ethoxy sulfuron @ 13kg/10 litre of water controls the Cyprus sp.

Expert System for Sugarcane Expert System For Sugarcane Categories Botany & Climate Season & Varieties Nursery Management Cultivation Practices Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative Irrigation Management Nutrient Management Crop Protection Farm Implements Post Harvest Technology Marketing Institutions & Schemes FAQ's Related Links Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative(SSI) About Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative The major principles that govern SSI can be stated as below Cultivation aspects Fertigation schedule for sugarcane in SSI Comparison between Conventional and SSI methods of Sugarcane Cultivation Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative The Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative (SSI) is yet another practical approach to sugarcane production which is based on the principles of ‘more with less’ in agriculture like System of Rice Intensification (SRI). SSI improves the productivity of water, land and labour, all at the same time, while reducing the overall pressure on water resources. Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative is a method of sugarcane production which involves using less seeds, less water and optimum utilization of fertilizers and land to achieve more yields. Driven by farmers, SSI is an alternate to conventional seed, water and space intensive Sugarcane cultivation. Top of page The major principles that govern SSI can be stated as below: Raising nursery using single-budded chips (conventionally, 2-3 budded sets are used and normally no nursery is prepared). Transplanting young seedlings (25-35 days old), after grading (conventionally, direct planting of 3-budded chips is done). Raising a nursery and grading reduces plant mortality significantly as compared to conventional cultivation. Maintaining wide spacing (5 x 2 feet) in the main field, which reduces the seed requirement by 75% from 48,000 (16000 3-budded chips) to 5000 single-budded chips per acre (conventional spacing is 1.5 x 2.5 ft). Wider spacing supports easy air and sunlight penetration in the crop canopy, leading to better and healthier cane growth. It also allows for easier intercultural operations. Providing sufficient moisture and avoiding inundation of water, whereby 40% of water is saved (conventionally, flooding is practiced). This is significant as sugarcane consumes about 2500L of water per kg of sugarcane produced. Encouraging organic methods of nutrient management and plant protection. Practicing intercropping (which is possible due to wider spacing and non-flooding), thereby increasing effective utilization of land, giving additional income and reducing weed growth by 60%. All of the above practices, lead to increased length and weight of individual canes, and alteast 20-25 tillers/plant and 9-10 millable canes/plant, as compared to 10-15 tillers and 4-5 millable canes in conventional cultivation. Top of page Cultivation aspects Bud selection Select healthy canes of 7 to 9 months old with10-12 buds per cane. Remove buds from the selected canes using an implement called Bud Chipper The chipped buds have to be treated with organic or chemical solutions. 450-500 canes per acre is required. Nursery preparation Take-well decomposed coco-pith. Fill half of each cone in the tray with coco-pith. Place the buds flat or in a slightly slanting position in the cones of a tray. Cover the bud chips in trays completely with coco-pith. Care should be taken to avoid water, air or sunlight entering into the trays by tightly covering and keeping the bundles in shade net or preferably inside a room. Create artificial warmth through electric bulbs if the climate is too cold. This is the most crucial phase of the nursery management. Under proper conditions (especially, warm temperature) within 3 – 5 days, white roots (primodia) will come out and shoots will also appear in next 2 to 3 days. Based on the moisture content of coco-pith, watering to the trays (seedlings) has to be initiated in the evenings for the next 15 days using rose cans. During six leaf stage (about 20 days old seedling), grading of the plants has to be done. Top of page Main field preparation The main field preparation in SSI method is similar to that of conventional method. A good land preparation should be done. a.Removal of residues Main land preparation for sugarcane starts with clearing the preceding crop residues. Stubbles are to be collected and removed from the field. All residues can be incorporated into soil by a rotavator. b. Tillage Tillage operations through tractor drawn implements are most ideal and quick. After one or two initial ploughings, soil must be allowed to weather for a week or two before going for further tillage operations. c. Addition of organic manures The SSI method encourages application of organic manure as it enhances the macro and micro nutrient content in the soil in an eco friendly way, helps in optimum utilization of some of the chemical fertilizers and protects the soil from degradation and other hazardous effects. d. Making furrows and ridges • Make furrows with a distance of 5 ft in between • Run a sub-soiler attached to the ridger/plough through the furrow to loosen the soil. This will support proper incorporation of the manure, deep plantation and prevention of lodging. Fertilizer application Nutrient management in sugarcane cultivation is very essential for crop growth. It is always better to know the required quantity of nutrients through soil testing and enrich the soil accordingly. If there is no facility for that, then NPK can be applied at the rate of 112 kg, 25 kg and 48 kg per acre, respectively through inorganic or organic methods. Transplanting The ideal age for transplanting the young seedlings from nursery to the main field is 25 to 35 days. While transplanting to the main field, zigzag method of planting (see picture) can be followed to utilize more space and achieve maximum tillers. Plant to plant distance of 2 ft has to be maintained for easy sunlight penetration and profuse tillering. All the other cultivation practices are same as conventional method. Intercropping SSI supports intercropping in sugarcane with crops like wheat, potato, cowpea, french bean, chickpea, water melon, brinjal etc. In addition to effective utilization of land, this practice will reduce the weed growth up to 60% and give extra income to farmers. Weeding A weed-free environment is absolutely essential for efficient intake of nutrients. This can be achieved by: • Deep ploughing and removal of perennial weeds. • Hand weedings and mechanical weedings (30, 60 and 90days after planting) are better for long term benefits. Top of page Mulching Trash mulching is important in sugarcane cultivation as it helps in checking the weeds and providing needed moisture. Sugarcane trash can be applied @ 1.5 t/acre within 3days of planting. Similarly, after detrashing the removed leaves can be applied in the interspaces as mulch. Organic method of cultivation The SSI method encourages application of organic manure as it enhances the macro and micro nutrient content in the soil in an eco friendly way, helps in optimum utilization of some of the chemical fertilizers and protects the soil from degradation and other hazardous effects. Apply organic manure like FYM/compost/well-decomposed press mud (about 8-10 tonnes/acre). Quantity of organic manure could be adjusted in such a way as to supply 112 kg N/acre through one or more sources depending on their N content. Trichoderma and Pseudomonas (each 1 kg/acre) and Decomposing cultures can be mixed with the organic manures. This will improve the soil fertility to realize higher yields. Water management Drip irrigation can be practiced effectively in SSI due to wider spacing and raising of single seedlings. It is always better to provide sufficient quantity of water on time rather than flooding the field with enormous amount of water. In conventional flooding method water is always applied more than the biological demand of the crop which may affect the crop growth. After transplantation, the frequency of the irrigation may differ depending on the soil type, age of the crop, rainfall and moisture availability. For sandy soil, the frequency will be more and for clay soil it will be less. Give irrigation once in 10 days during tillering stage (36-100 days), once in 7 days during Grand Growth period (101-270 days) and once in 15 days during Maturity period (from 271 days till harvest) Furrow irrigation helps in proper application and saving of water. Alternate furrow irrigation means irrigating the furrows of odd numbers initially followed by irrigating the furrows of even numbers after 7 to 15 days as per the moisture content and age of the crop. This will ensure saving of water up to 50%.

Sucrose content in the plants will reach the desirable level on the 10th month of the one year crop duration, and they will be ready for harvest within the next two months. Overall benefits  In conventional method, cost of setts occupies the major part of cost of cultivation  By practicing SSI, this seed cost can be reduced up to 75%  Reduction in the plant mortality rate  Increases in the length and weight of each cane  It is easy to transport the young seedlings for longer distance  Intercultural operations can be carried out easily due to wider spacing Scope of SSI in Tamil Nadu Tamil Nadu, being the number one state in sugarcane productivity (more than 100 t/ha), has a great potential in SSI. The following are some of the reasons to foresee the great impact of SSI in Tamil Nadu sugarcane sector. Farmers are very much innovative, eager to take up any new technologies with great enthusiasm and support. SSI will be a suitable option to solve the present problems of increasing seed cost, labour cost and other soil fertility and productivity related issues. Due to wider spacing, intercultural operation becomes easy, thus reducing the drudgery among women labourers. The wider spacing suggested in SSI are ideal in case of introducing Mechanical harvester, an effort already in practice in some of the Mills areas in Tamil Nadu. Conclusion SSI involves use of less seeds, less water and optimum land utilization to achieve more yields. It is governed by some principles like using single budded chips, raising nursery, wider spacing, sufficient irrigation and intercropping. By practicing these measures, the following benefits can be realized: Better germination percentage High number of millable canes Reduction in the duration of crop to some extent Increased water use efficiency Improvement in accessibility to nutrients with optimum use of fertilizers More accessibility to air and sunlight Reduction in cost of cultivation and Extra income from intercrops On the whole, by practicing SSI farmers can very well increase their productivity by reducing the use of inputs like fertilizers and saving the vital resources like water simultaneously. Hence, it is very much possible for sugarcane farmers to reap greater economical benefits by maintaining ecological sustainability. Top of page Copyright © TNAU | All Rights Reserved

The crop sown in trenches needs relatively less water but sandy soils and application of more fertilizers increase the water uptake. On an average 1 ton cane needs about 60-70 tons of water or thin varieties of cane need 150 cm thick canes and need 200 cm water and Adsali planted canes 200 cm, in addition to 75 cm rainfall. The crop should be irrigated when available water reaches to 50% level. The soil must have sufficient moisture at the time of sowing. First irrigation should be done when about 20-25% plant have germinated or about 20 days after sowing and the irrigations are given at 10-15 days interval during summer, 25-30 days interval during winter and if there is drought the crop should be irrigated during rainy season also as and when needed. The crop needs maximum water at tillering stage and during elongation or grand growth phase. Under water logging conditions the root respiration becomes poor. Nutrients are leached down, activities of useful micro-organisms are reduced and the crop lodges down with an excessive branching. Thus the quality becomes poor along with very low crop yield. These all make it necessary to drain the excess water from the field. Top of page Average water requirement for sugarcane Average water requirement for sugarcane is 1800 to 2200 mm.

Top of page Irrigation Methods Flood irrigation: In Flood irrigation method, free flow of irrigation water is allowed in the fields in all directions. It is practiced in the flat planted cane, but water loss is high. Furrow irrigation: Furrow irrigation is most commonly used and is particularly effective for early plant crop. In later crop growth periods and during ratoon crops, the water distribution may become increasingly problematic because of deterioration of the furrows. Reduced furrow length is sometimes used to allow better distribution of water over the field in a later stage. Alternate skip furrow method: In skip-furrow method, sugarcane is planted in flat beds as usual and after germination, 45 cm wide and 15 cm deep furrows were made in alternate inter row spaces. There is considerable saving of water in this method of irrigation. In Autumn planting, there are 7 irrigations in plains (5 before rain and 2 after rain) In spring planting, there are 6 irrigations (4 before rain and 2 after rain) - one irrigation at tillering is must. Sprinkler irrigation: For sprinkler irrigation, increasing use is made of spray guns, hand and automatically moved, replacing the cumbersome boom and labour-intensive hand-moved sprinkler laterals Prevailing winds of more than 4 or 5 m/sec will limit their usefulness. Drip irrigation: Drip irrigation is defined as the precise, slow and frequent application of water through point or line source emitters on or below the soil surface at a small operating pressure (20-200 kPa) and at a low discharge rate (0.6 to 20 LPH), resulting in partial wetting of the soil surface. Top of page Drip Irrigation Drip Irrigation Drip irrigation is defined as the precise, slow and frequent application of water through point or line source emitters on or below the soil surface at a small operating pressure (20-200 kPa) and at a low discharge rate (0.6 to 20 LPH), resulting in partial wetting of the soil surface. Drip irrigation in sugarcane is a relatively new innovative technology that can conserve water, energy and increase profits. Drip irrigation may help in solving three most important problems of irrigated sugarcane - water scarcity, rising pumping (energy) costs and depressed farm profits Drip will be successful depends on a host of agronomic, engineering and economic factors. 12 mm drip laterals have to be placed in the middle ridge of each furrow with the lateral spacing of 240 cm & 8 ‘Lph’ clog free drippers should be placed with a spacing of 75 cm on the lateral lines. The lateral length should not exceed more than 30-40 m. Drip Irrigation is given once in three days based on the evapo-transpiration demand of the crop. Surface Drip: The application of water to the soil surface as drops or a tiny stream through emitters placed at predetermined distance along the drip lateral is termed as surface drip irrigation. It can be of two types - online or integral type surface drip system. Integral dripline is recommended for sugarcane. Top of page Subsurface Drip (SDI): The application of water below the soil surface through emitters molded on the inner wall of the dripline, with discharge rates (1.0 - 3.0 LPH) generally in the same range as integral surface drip irrigation. The integral dripline (thin or thick-walled) is installed at some predetermined depth in the soil depending on the soil type and crop requirements. There are two main types of SDI - "one crop" and "multicrop". Subsurface irrigation saves water and improves yields by eliminating surface water evaporation and reducing the incidence of disease and weeds. Advantages Save 25-50% of water Low requirement of water. Evaporation losses get reduce. Decrease the number of weeds. Period of irrigation is low (2-3 hours) The growth of plants is homogeneous. Little application of water but gives more yield. Decrease the infestation with pests (insects, diseases and weeds). Increasing the area of planting by saving the area of canals. Decreasing man infection by contacting the water (bilharzia or Schistosomiasis). Decreasing the pollution in canals. There is considerable saving of water in this method of irrigation.

The cost of chemical fertilizers has also increased and there is a need to improve fertilizer use efficiency for more benefits. The best answer to this challenge is "Fertigation", where both water and fertilizers are delivered to crop simultaneously through a drip irrigation system. Fertigation ensures that essential nutrients are supplied precisely at the area of most intensive root activity according to the specific requirements of sugarcane crop and type of soil resulting in higher cane yields and sugar recovery. Concept of fertigation Fertigation is the judicious application of fertilizers by combining with irrigation water. Fertigation can be achieved through fertilizer tank, venturi System, Injector Pump, Non-Electric Proportional Liquid Dispenser (NEPLD) and automated system. Recommended Nitrogen & Potassium @ of 275 and 112.5 kg/ha may be applied in 14 equal splits with 15 days interval from 15 DAP. 25 kg Nitrogen and 8 kg K2O per ha per split. Urea and MOP (white potash) fertilizers can be used as Nitrogen and Potassium sources respectively. Fertigation up to 210 DAP can also be recommended. Requirement & Type of Water soluble fertilizers in Sugarcane Recommended dose: 275: 62.5:112.5 kg NPK / ha For Fertigation recommended: 275:15:112.5 NPK / ha Fertigation Schedule Crop stage Duration in days Fertilizer grade No. of times Quantity (kg/time) First stage From planting to 70 days(5,10…. 70th day) 12-61-00 14 0.9 13-00-45 14 1.8 Urea 14 12.1 Second stage 71 days to 120 days 12-61-00 10 1.2 13-00-45 10 5.0 Urea 10 20.9 Third stage 121 days to 160 days 12-61-00 8 3.1 13-00-45 8 5.6 Urea 8 14.1 Fourth stage 161 day to 210 days 12-61-00 10 2.5 13-00-45 10 6.8 Urea 10 8.3 Fertigation Schedule for Seasonal (12 months)/Ratoon Sugarcane Days After Planting Nutrients (kg/ha/day) N P2O5 K2O 1-30 Days 1.20 0.10 0.20 31-80 Days 1.50 0.40 0.24 81-110 Days 2.00 1.00 0.40 111-150 Days 0.75 0.30 0.75 151-190 Days -- 1.50 Fertigation Schedule for Preseasonal (14 to 16 months) Sugarcane Days After Planting Nutrients (kg/ha/day) N P2O5 K2O 1-30 Days 1.5 0.15 0.25 31-80 Days 2.0 0.60 0.30 81-110 Days 2.5 1.50 0.50 111-150 Days 0.75 0.50 1.0 151-190 Days -- 1.80 Advantages of fertigation Ensures a regular flow of water as well as nutrients resulting in increased growth rates for higher yields Offers greater versatility in the timing of the nutrient application to meet specific crop demands Safer application method which eliminates the danger of burning the plant root system Offers simpler and more convenient application than soil application of fertilizer thus saving time, labour, equipment and energy Improves fertilizer use efficiency Reduction of soil compaction and mechanical damage to the crops Convenient use of compound and ready-mix nutrient solutions containing also small concentration of micronutrients. Free from chlorides and sodium No salt build up in the crop root zone Most of the fertilizers are blended with micronutrients. Fertigation Offers Several Distinct Advantages in Comparison to Conventional Application Methods: Distribution of plant nutrients more evenly throughout the wetted root zone resulting in increased nutrient availability & uptake contributing to higher crop growth rates and cane yields Supply of nutrients incrementally according to the crop developmental phases throughout the season to meet the actual nutritional requirements of the crop Careful regulation and monitoring the supply of nutrients Application of nutrients to the soil when crop or soil conditions would otherwise prohibit entry into the field with conventional equipment Minimal nutrient losses through consumption by weeds, leaching and runoff No damage to the crop by root pruning, breakage of leaves, or bending of leaves, as occurs with conventional fertilizer application methods/equipment Less energy is expended in application of the fertilizer Usually less labour & equipment are required for application of the fertilizer and to supervise the application Soil compaction is avoided because heavy equipment never enters the field No salt injury to foliage Allows rising of crop on marginal lands, where accurate control of water and nutrient ion in the plant's root environment is critical.

Infact, when evapo-transpiration exceeds soil moisture supply i.e. water uptake, the water deficit/drought is resulted. Sugarcane being a long duration crop which requires more irrigation. In sugarcane, Germination and grand growth phase are the two important periods which requires more irrigation. In India this period comes on summer months and availability of water is poor. So the requirement of water is insufficient during those period which leads to drying of crop and yield loss. Drought Management: Planting of sugarcane in early season at the depth of 30 cm in furrow. In drought area plant the setts with spacing of 60-75 cm instead of 90 cm. Soak the setts in lime solution (80 kg Kiln lime in 400 lit water) for one hour. Removal of dry trash at 5th month and leave it as mulch, in the field. This reduces the temperature upto 2ºC. Spray potash and urea each at 25 gm in 1 litre of water during moisture stress period at 15 days interval. Spray Kaolin (60 g in 1 ltr. of water) to alleviate the water stress. Under water scarcity condition, alternate furrow and skip furrow irrigation method is beneficial. Apply 125 kg of Muriate of Potash additionally at 120 day of planting. Basal incorporation of coir waste @ 25 tonnes/ha at the time of last ploughing. Use drought tolerant resistant varieties like Co 86032, Co 99004, Co 94008 and Co 86249 Top of page Copyright © TNAU | All Rights Reserved

During vegetation the sugarcane consumes many nutrients. There is no doubt that sugarcane crop needs nutrients. The most active uptake of nutrients is observed during the early stage of the sugarcane plant, during tillering (from the third to the sixth months after planting). The nutrient needs of sugarcane can be assessed by soil analysis, plant tissue analysis and / or deficiency symptoms. A combination of these three methods gives the most complete inventory of the nutrient status of a crop. Top of page Role of Nutrient Plants require 16 essential nutrient elements. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are derived from the atmosphere and soil water. The remaining 13 essential elements (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, boron, molybdenum, and chlorine) are supplied either from soil minerals and soil organic matter or by organic or inorganic fertilizers. These nutrients are essential for proper crop development. Each is equally important to the plant. Major Nutrient Nitrogen Influences sugarcane yield and quality. Required for vegetative growth (tillering, foliage formation, stalk formation and growth) and root growth. Vegetative growth in sugarcane is directly related to yield. Excess Nitrogen leads to: harmful to crop prolongs vegetative growth delays maturity and ripening increases reducing sugar content in juice lowering juice quality increases soluble N in juice affecting clarification susceptible to lodging, pest and disease incidence Phosphorus Uptake depends on presence of soluble and plant absorbable form. P- requirement is relatively less than N and K. Necessary for formation of proteins and thus for yield build up. Important for cell division leads to crop growth Stimulates root growth Necessary for plant metabolism and photo synthesis Required for adequate tillering Interacts with N and thus enhance ripening. Excess P is wasted due to fixation in soil Potassium Requirement of K is greater than N and P. Required for carbon assimilation, photo synthesis translocation of carbohydrates Involved in various enzymatic activities Important for sugar synthesis and translocation to the storage organs. Develops resistance to sugarcane against pest, disease and lodging. Maintains cell turgidity under moisture stress conditions. Balances the effect of N and P Excess availability of K leads to "Luxury consumption". Top of page Minor Nutrients Sulphur: It is essential for synthesis of amino acids, protein and vitamins in sugarcane. It increases the juice quality, CCS% and cane yield, Zinc: It is essential for bio synthesis of plant growth regulator. Activity of various enzymes also depended upon the presence of zinc. Manganese: It is activator of many enzymes involve in protein synthesis of sugarcane. It increasing the yield, quality and nutrient content of sugarcane crop. Boron: The main functions of boron relate to cell wall strength and development, cell division For cane development, sugar transport, and hormone development. Magnesium: Mg is the central element of the chlorophyll molecule. Carrier of Phosphorus in the plant Magnesium is both an enzyme activator and a constituent of many enzymes Sugar synthesis Copper: It is a constituent of several enzyme systems involved in building and converting amino acids to proteins. Copper is important in carbohydrate and protein metabolism. It is important to the formation of lignin in plant cell walls which contributes to the structural strength of the cells, and the cane. Top of page Nutrient Application Basal application Basal application of organic manures: 1. Apply FYM at 12.5 t/ha or compost 25 t/ha or filter press mud at 37.5 t/ha before the last ploughing under gardenland conditions. 2. In wetlands this may be applied along the furrows and incorporated well. Basal Application of Fertilizer Test the soil and apply P fertilizer based on soil test values. Otherwise apply super phosphate (375 kg/ha) along the furrows and incorporate with hand hoe. Apply 37.5 kg Zinc sulphate/ha and 100 kg Ferrous sulphate/ha to zinc and iron deficient soils. Apply phosphorus in the furrow bottom and mix slightly with soil before planting. Nitrogen and potassium fertilizer are given in split doses, applied in bands on either side of the cane row. Top Dressing with Fertilizers Soil application Apply 275 kg of nitrogen and 112.5 kg of K2O/ha in three equal splits at 30, 60 and 90 days in coastal and flow irrigated belts (assured water supply areas). In the case of lift irrigation belt, apply 225 kg of nitrogen and 112.5 kg of K2O/ha in three equal splits at 30, 60 and 90 days (water scarcity areas). For jaggery areas, apply 175 kg of nitrogen and 112.5 kg of K2O/ha in three equal splits on 30, 60 and 90 days. Cover the fertilizer with soil immediately after placement to reduce volatilization losses. This is also achieved by partial earthing after first top dressing and full earthing up after second top dressing. Foliar application Foliar nutrition of urea (1 to 2.5%) and potassium (2.5%) under moisture stress is a useful practice to improve cane yield and quality. Foliar application of DAP formed to be useful to improve yield and quality. Good foliage wetting is necessary. 'Teepol' can be used as a wetting agent. Sprayings done preferably in the morning hours. A boom sprayer may be used in a grown up crop. For Nitrogen Saving Neem Cake Blended Urea: Apply 67.5 kg of N/ha + 27.5 kg of Neem Cake at 30 days and repeat on 60th and 90th days. Note: Neem cake blending: Powder the required quantity of neem cake and mix it with urea thoroughly and keep it for 24 hours. Thus, 75 kg of nitrogen/ha can be saved by this method. Azospirillum: Mix 12 packets (2400 g)/ha of Azospirillum inoculant or TNAU Biofert –1 with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg soil and apply near the clumps on 30th day of planting. Repeat the same on 60th day with another 12 packets (2400 gm). Repeat the above on the other side of the crop row on the 90th day (for lift irrigated belt). Band placement: Open deep furrows of 15 cm depth with hand hoes and place the fertilisers in the form of band and cover it properly. Subsurface application: Application of 255 kg of Nitrogen in the form of urea along with potash at 15 cm depth by the side of the cane clump will result in the saving of 20 kg N/ha without any yield reduction. Common Micronutrient mixture : To provide all micronutrients to sugarcane, 50 kg /ha of micronutrient mixture containing 20 kg Ferrous sulphate,10 kg Manganese sulphate, 10 kg Zinc sulphate, 5 kg of Copper sulphate, 5 kg of Borax mixed with 100 kg of well decomposed FYM, can be recommended as soil application prior to planting. Top of page Organic manure Farm yard manure: For sugarcane, apply 12.5 t/ha of FYM before the last ploughing. An average well decomposed farmyard manure contains 0.5 per cent N, 0.2 per cent P2O5and 0.5 per cent K2O. When cow dung and urine are mixed, a balanced nutrition is made available for cane growth. Green manure: Sow green manure crops like daincha or sunhemp on one side of the ridges on 3rd or 4th day after planting sugarcane and raise it as an intercrop with sugarcane. Harvest and insitu incorporate the intercrop around 45 days after transplanting. Green manure adds about 7.5 to 25 tonnes of green matter per ha contributing about 10 – 30 kg N per ha. Daincha has around 0.62% N and sunhemp contains 0.75% N, 0.12% P2O5 and 0.51% K2O. Press Mud: Press Mud is a by-product of sugar industry. For every 100 tonnes of sugarcane crushed about 3 tonnes of press mud cake is left behind as by-product. Apply 37.5 t/ha of press mud before planting. It contains 1.2%N, 2.1-2.4% P2O5 and 2.0% K2O. It contains trace quantity of micronutrients and prevents soil erosion, crusting and cracking, adjust soil pH, improves drainage and promotes normal bacterial and microbial growth in the soil. Reinforced compost from sugarcane trash and press mud: Spread the sugarcane trash to a thickness of 15 cm over an area of 7 m X 3 m. Then apply pressmud over this trash to a thickness of 5 cm. Sprinkle the fertilizer mixture containing mussoorie rock phosphate, gypsum and urea in the ration of 2:2:1 over these layers at the rate of 5 kg/100 kg of trash. Moist the trash and pressmud layers adequately with water. Repeat this process till the entire heap rises to a height of 1.5m. Use cowdung slurry instead of water to moist the layer wherever it is available. Cover the heap with a layer of soil and pressmud at 1:1 ratio to a thickness of 15 cm. Leave the heap as such for three months for decomposition. Moist the heap once in 15 days. During rainy season, avoid moistening the heap. After three months, turn and mix the heap thoroughly and form a heap and leave it for one month. Then turn and mix heap thoroughly at the end of the fourth month. Moist the heap once in 15 days during 4th and 5th month also. This method increases the manurial value of trash compost by increasing, N, P and Ca content. It also brings down the C:N ratio by 10 times as compared to raw cane trash. Bio fertilizer: Application of azospirillum gives atmospheric nitrogen to the sugarcane crop. By applying phosphobacteria crop can get undissolved phosphorous from soil without any loss. Apply azospirillum 5 kg/ha, phosphobacteria 5 kg/ha and FYM 500 kg /ha mix it and apply on 30 days after planting along the furrow and irrigated it. Same repeated on 60th day. Bio fertilizer can also apply through fertigation. Don’t mix the bio fertilizer and chemical fertilizer for application. Apply bio fertilizer as 10- 15 days before or after application of chemical fertilizer. Neem cake: Neem cake is the residue left, after oil has been extracted from neem seed kernel. It performs the dual function of both fertilizer as well as It contains Nitrogen 2.0% to 5.0%, Phosphorus 0.5% to 1.0% and Potassium 1.0% to 2.0%. Apply 27.5 kg/ha of neem cake on 30th, 60th and 90th day Top of page Nutritional disorders Nitrogen: All leaves of sugarcane exhibit a yellow – green colour. Retardation of growth. Cane stalks are smaller in diameter. Premature drying of older leaves. Roots attain a greater length but are smaller in diameter. Management: Soil application of N fertilizer or foliar spray of urea 1-2% twice at weekly interval. Phosphorus: Reduction in length of sugarcane stalks, diameters of which taper rapidly at growing points. Colour of the leaves is greenish blue, narrow and somewhat reduce length. Reduced tillering. Decreased shoot / root ratio with restricted root development. Management: Foliar spray of DAP 2% twice at fortnight interval Potassium: Depressed growth Yellowing and marginal drying of older leaves and Development of slender stalks. Orange, yellow colour appears in the older lower leaves which develop numerous chlorotic spots that later become brown with dead centre result in ‘firing’ apperance. Reddish discoloration which is confined to the epidermal cells of the upper surfaces and midribs of the leaves. Bunchy top apperance. Poor root growth with less member of root hairs. Management: Foliar spray of KCL 1% twice at fortnight interval Zinc: Earlier development of anthrocyanin pigments in the leaves. Pronounced bleaching of the green colour along the major veins Striped effect due to a loss of Chlorophyll along the veins. At sever stage necrosis and growth ceases at the growing point (meristem). Mangement: Soil application of 37.5 kg Zinc sulphate/ha before the last ploughing. Iron: Young leaves where pale stripes with scanty chlorophyll content occur between parallel lines. Leaves turn completely white, even in the veins and midribs. Restricted Root growth. Management: Soil application of 25kg/ha of FeSO4 or foliar spray of FESO4 0.5% on 90, 105 and 120 days after planting. Calcium: Mottling and chlorosis of older leaves Spindles often become necrotic at the leaf tip and long margins Rusty appearance and premature death of older leaves Management: Soil application of 100kg/ha of gypsum Magnesium: Mottled or chlorotic appearance at the tip and margins Red necrotic lesions resulting in "rusty" appearance Internal browning of rind Management: Soil application of MgSo4 25kg/ha or foliar spray of MgSo4 2% twice at fortnight interval. Sulphur: Chlorotic young leaves Narrower and shorter leaves with faint purplish tinge Slender stalks Management: It is advisable to use sulphur containing fertilisers: Ammonium Sulphate - 24% S Single Super Phosphate - 12% S Potassium Sulphate - 18% S Gypsum - 13-18% S Any one of the above fertilizers at the rate of 10-20 kg/ha. Molybdenum: Short longitudinal chlorotic streaks on the top one-third of the leaf. Short and slender stalks Slow vegetative growth. Management: Application of ammonium molybedate (54% Mo) and sodium molybdate (39% Mo) are common sources of Mo to reactify its deficiency in soils and crops. Top of page INTEGRATED NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT In many sugarcane growing areas, the productivity of the soils has declined due to intensive cropping and lack of proper soil fertility management practices. The soil productivity can be restored through rationalized integrated nutrient management (INM) involving organic manures, fertilisers and biofertilisers. Bulky organic manures like farmyard manure, compost and pressmud must be incorporated into the soil at the rate of 15 to 25 t/ha before planting Sunnhemp green manure can be grown as intercrop and incorporated into the soil around 30 to 45 days after planting. Soil-test based fertiliser schedules are advisable. When this is not possible, a blanket schedule of 275-65-115 kg of N, P and K can be adopted. Phosphatic fertilisers, preferably super phosphates can be applied basally or at the time of first hoeing and weeding during 30 to 45 days after planting. Nitrogenous and potassic fertilisers must be applied in four splits, first split during 30  45 days, second split during 60-75 days, third split during 90  105 days and fourth split during 120  135 days after planting. The efficiency of urea can be enhanced by blending it with neem cake powder in 4:1 ratio, a day before application. It is advisable to apply the mixture of urea and potash fertiliser in holes of 10 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm spacing on the sides of the plant rows. Fifty kg of micronutrient mixture/ha made up of 20 kg of ferrous sulphate, 10 kg of manganous sulphate, 10 kg of zinc sulphate, 5 kg of copper sulphate and 5 kg of borax may be applied basally in the planting furrows. When the chlorotic symptoms due to deficiency of iron or zinc are observed on the leaves of the crop, 5 kg of ferrous sulphate, 2.5 kg of zinc sulphate and 5 kg of urea per hectare may be dissolved in 500 litres of water and sprayed over the foliage. If necessary, one or two more sprayings can be given at intervals of 15 days. Azospirillum and phosphobacteria biofertilisers at 10 kg each/ha may be mixed with 10 kg of compost and applied basally in the planting furrows or at the time of first hoeing and weeding during 30  45 days after planting. The soil pH must be maintained in the neutral range of 6.5 to 7.5 for the crop.

Biological method: Release egg parasite, Trichogramma chilonis at the rate of 2.5 cc / release / ha. Six release at fortnightly intervals starting from 4th month onwards. Setting pheromone traps at spindle level on 5th month of the crop at the rate of 6 traps per acre in a 15 metre grid. The pheromone septa need to be changed twice at 75 days interval. Chemical method: Avoid the use of excessive nitrogenous fertilizers. Top Borer, Scirpophaa excerptalis (Fb.) Distribution: Present in all states. In Tamil Nadu it is severe in Trichy, Tanjore and Cuddalore districts. Symptom of damage: Dead heart arise on after sixth month grown up canes, which cannot be easily pulled. Parallel row of shot holes in the emerging leaves. Bore holes at the top of the shoot and shows bunchy top appearance. Nature of damage: Caterpillars are mainly found in the apical portion of the canes, boring through the growing point and down the upper joints until it reaches the sappy portion of the stem, there it feeds on the tissues and destroys the cane. They also bore into the unfolded leaves preferably into the midrib, mining its way to the base. Life cycle: Egg: Eggs are laid on the lower surface of top leaves in clusters particularly near midribs. The clusters are covered with buff coloured hairs. : 10-80 eggs per egg mass Larva: Smooth, white or cream coloured with a red coloured mid – dorsal line and yellow head. Pupa: Pupation takes place within the larval tunnel in a chamber with an exit hole Constructed by the caterpillar.

Physical method: Collect and destroy the egg masses. Biological method: Release Ichneumonid parasitized Gambroides (Isotima) javensis @ 100 pairs / ha as prepupal parasitoid. Chemical method: Application of Carbofuran 3G 1 kg a.i/ha or Thimet 10G 3 kg a.i/ha Termites, Odontotermes obesus Rhamb Symptom of damage: Poor germination of setts (after planting), characteristic semi – circular feeding marks on the margin of the leaves in the standing crop. Causes yellowing and drying of outer leaves first followed by the inner leaves Entire shoot dries up and can be pulled out. Setts hollow inside and may be filled with soil. Cane collapses if disturbed; rind filled with mud. Life cycle: Eggs: Dull, kidney shaped and hatches in 30-90 days Nymphs: Moult 8-9 times and are full grown in 6-12 months Adult: Creamy coloured tiny insects resembling ants with dark coloured head Management: Cultural method: Flood irrigation at the time of planting.

Treat the soil with lindane 1.6 D @ 50 kg / ha or Apply 125 kg of heptachlor 3 % D per ha in the furrows at time of planting. White Grub, Holotrichia consanguinea (Blanch) Symptom of damage: Yellowing and wilting of leaves. Drying of entire crown. Affected canes come off easily when pulled. Cause extensive damage to roots and base of shoot. Life cycle: Egg: A female lays on an average of 27 eggs in the soil, which are pear like white enclosed in earthen cells. Grub: Fleshy ‘C’ shaped, whitish yellow in colour found close to the base of the clump. Pupa: Pupae are tan to brown, and occur deeper in the soil in earthen chambers. Adult: Adult beetles are a rusty-red color just after emerging from the pupal stage, but turn nearly black. Management: Cultural method: Provide adequate irrigation. Deep ploughing immediately after harvesting. Physical method: Set up light trap. Collect and destroy the adult beetles. Chemical method: Apply lindane 1.6 D @ 50 kg/ha near the root zone. Sugarcane Wooly Aphid, Ceratovacuna lanigera Symptoms: Adults and nymphs desap leaves by piercing styles through stomata. Whitish patches – coalesce to turn yellowish and drying from the tip along margins. Leaves become brittle and dries completely. Heavy secretion of honey dew – development of sooty mould. Deposition of wooly matter on ground / soil distinctly visible. Life cycle: Adult emerged after fourth moult and viviparous reproduction. Apterous (Wingless) female reproduce parthenogenetically. Each femal produced about 15 – 35 young ones within 24 hr after mating. Each female reproduces maximum of 217 nymphs during the period of 20 days. The female are more in the population, which leads to fast multiplication. Nymph takes 6 to 22 days to complete four instars and become adult. The life cycle of female complete within one – month period. The longevity of adult is from 32 to 57 days. The life cycle may vary according to the climatic conditions and variety. In most of the affected fields at various locations all the nymphal instars and adults are noticed. In extreme cases, the winter is passed as eggs which are laid during the previous autumn by sexual females. In spring they hatch and give rise to apterous parthenogenetic viviparous females. The winged females appear in such swarms as to darken the sky and cover the vegetation. The non-migratory species, the whole life – cycle is spent on the same plant. Management: Cultural Method: Paired row system of planting. Avoid excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers. Use of organic fertilizers. Rapping of canes all along the rows. Infested tops should not be transported. Infested canes should not be used as seed for planting. Biological Method: Encourage local predators like Diapha aphidivora Meyrick – Pyralidae Ishchiodon scutellaris Episyrphus baleatus – Syrphidae Chrysopa spp. – Chryospidae Schymnus sp. Cheilomeness sexmaculata, Coccinella septempunctata, Synnonycha grandis Brumus sp. and Dideopsis aegrota – Coccinellidae Pathogens like Cladosporium oxysporum, Metarhizium anisopliae, Verticillium lecanii and Beauveria bassiana Chemical Method: Dip the seed sets in Chlorpyripos 20 EC solution (2 ml / lit) before planting. Apply phorate 10 G @ 5kg / ac or Spray with acephate75 SP 1g / lit Chlorpyriphos 20 EC 2 ml / lit Malathion 50 EC 2 ml / lit Dimethoate 30 EC 1.7 ml / lit, Oxydemeton methyl 25 EC 1.3 ml / lit, Dusting with Malathion 5% dust @ 10 kg / ac. Whiteflies, Aleurolobus barodensis Symptom of damage: Yellowing of leaves Leaf turns pinkish or purple and later gradually dry. Infested leaves look white and black dots. Life cycle: Egg: Females lay eggs in a line near the midrib or any where on the lower surface of the leaves. Eggs are yellowish with a small curved stalk. Colour changes to black about two hours after the eggs are laid. Nymph & Pupa: Neonate nymphs are pale yellow in colour, flat and oval in shape, later turn shiny black. Its body is surrounded by fringes of wax.The fourth instar being the pupal stage, is flat, oval, grayish in colour and slightly bigger than the nymph. There is a ‘T’ shaped white marking on the thorax, which splits at the time of adult emergence. Adult: Pale yellow body with hyaline wings dusted with waxy bloom, exhibit brisk fluttering movements. Management: Cultural Method: Avoid indiscriminate use of insecticides for control of other pests such as pyrilla, black bug, wooly aphids Mechanical Method: Detrashing the puparia bearing leaves and immediately disposing by burning or burying to prevent emergence of adult white flies Chemical Method: Spray fenitrothion 50 EC @ 2 lit / ha (1000 lit spray fluid) Mealybug, Saccharicoccus sacchari Symptom of damage: Pinkish oval insects beneath leaf sheath on the nodes, with whitish mealy coating, main cane stunned also attack roots. Sooty mould develops on the honey dew giving blackish appearance on canes. Life cycle: Eggs: Eggs are retained in the female reproductive organs untils almost fully mature. Incubation period is short. The females may bring forth hundreds of young ones parthenogenetically. Egg is yellowish, smooth, cylindrical and rounded at both ends. Nymph: Newly emerged nymphs are quite active with a pinkish transparent body. Adult: White with mealy coating, sessile. Management: Cultural method: Use resistant varieties like CO 439, CO 443, CO 720, CO 730 and CO 7704 Drain excess water from the field. Physical method: Detrash the crop on 150 and 210 DAP Chemical method: Apply any one of the following insecticides per ha and when the incidence is noticed spray on the stem only, methyl parathion 50 EC 1000 ml, malathion 50 EC 1000 ml. Scale Insects, Melanaspis glomerata (Green) Symptom of damage: The leaves of infested canes show signs of tip drying and unhealthy pale green colour and with continued infestation these turn yellow. Desapping leads to non-opening of leaves also, which also turn yellow and finally dry up. Nodal region is more infested than internodal region. Infested crop losses its vigour, canes shrivel, growth is stunted and the internodal length is reduced drastically. Ultimately cane dries up. Such canes when slit open appear brownish red. Life cycle: Nymph: Females multiply ovo-viviparously. The nymphs that hatch out from the eggs within the female’s body come out through the genital aperture. They are called ‘crawlers’. They settle after selecting suitable site for feeding. Adult: Greyish black or brown circular scales, they cover the nodal region forming a thick encrustation. Management: Cultural method: Use resistant varieties like CO 439, CO 443, CO 453, CO 671, CO 691 and CO 692 Select and plant the scale insect free setts. Keep the fields and bunds free from weeds. Avoid water stagnation in the field for the longer period. Avoid repeated ratoons. Physical method: Detrash the crop at 150th and 210th day of planting. Biological method: Release Chilocoris nigritus (or) Pharascymnus horni. Chemical method: Presoak the setts in 0.1% solution malathion. Spray dimethoate 0.06% or 120th and 150th after detrashing. Nematodes Symptom: Usually paling of leaves, first in the form of streaks, later complete yellowing-chlorosis, occurring in patches spread out all over the field. Chlorosis in severe cases, accompanied by drying up of margins and leaf tips is more common in ratoon and young crop. Stunting of crop, reduction in number and size of internodes. Roots are stubby and spares. Affected field shows pale green to whitish look. Nematode types: There are several nematodes present in the soil of which, four nematodes are mainly damaging the sugarcane crop. They are: Lesion nematode - Pratylenchus coffeae Root-lesion nematodes are migratory endoparasites Females of P. penetrans lay about 1 or 2 eggs/day for about 35 days, with a maximum of 68 eggs being laid by one female. Eggs are laid singly or in clusters in both soil and roots. Second stage juveniles hatch after eggs have incubated for 9 (30 C) to 25 (15 C) days. Males are required for reproduction by P. penetrans but not by P. neglectus. Lance nematode - Hoplolaimus indicus Lance nematodes, Hoplolaimus spp., are ecto-parasites, sometimes semi-endo-parasites. Nematodes which are large and highly resistant to effects of temperature extremes and dry soil conditions. Larvae look similar to adults except that they are smaller.This group of nematodes is easily detected with soil sampling. Root knot nematode - Meloidogyne spp. Root knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms, obligate endo-parasites that complete most of their life cycle within their host roots. The nematodes survive in soil as eggs and also second stage larvae. Reniform nematode - Rotylenchulus reniformis. The term 'reniform' refers to the kidney-shaped body of the mature female. They are semi-endoparasitic (partially inside roots) species in which the females penetrate the root cortex, establish a permanent-feeding site in the stele region of the root and become sedentary or immobile. Management: Cultural method: Deep ploughing, solarisation, flooding, crop rotation and apply organic manure. Under wetland conditions, intercropping with sunnhemp or marigold or daincha Apply pressmud at 15 t/ha or poultry manure @ 2 t/ha or neem cake 2 t/ha or poultry manure @ 1 t/ha before last ploughing in garden lands. Biological method: Application of biocontrol agents like Pochonia chlamydosporia, Paecilomyces lilacinus or Trichoderma viride or Pseudomonas fluorescence @ 20 kg/ha at the time of planting mixed with moist FYM or cured pressmud and distributed uniformly will help in suppressing the plant parasitic nematode. Chemical method: Apply carbofuran 3G @ 33 kg/ha at the time of planting or 2 months after planting or Cartap 3 kg/ha (1.5 kg a.i./ha) Grasshoppers, Hieroglyphus banyan Symptom of damage: Adult and nymph grasshoppers feed on leaves from the margins of the leaf blades creating cutout areas during the solitary stage. finally it leaves only the leaf midrib. Identification of pest: Egg: Eggs in the form of egg pods, usually more than ten, either in the sand or among leaf litters. Each egg pod consists of about 10-300 eggs that are rice shaped. Nymph: Nymphs are miniature versions of adult grasshoppers, except that they are light in colour and do not possess wings. The nymphal stage may last for a period of 5-10 days. Adult: After about a month, a nymph becomes an adult. An adult grasshopper lives for 1-2 months. Management: Cultural method: Tillage - Tillage controls grasshoppers primarily by eliminating the green plants on which grasshoppers feed. Biological method: Baits containing the protozoan Nosema locustae is a biological control option that may be considered for treating grasshopper breeding sites. This is sold under the trade names Nolobait or Semaspore and can produce infection of many species of grasshoppers. Because it is selective in effects, only affecting grasshoppers. Sugarcane Diseases Red rot Symptoms The affected canes exhibit leaf colour change, from green to orange and then to yellow in the third or fourth leaf. Then the leaves start drying from bottom to top. The cane loses its normal colour and longitudinal discoloration spots / ribs are seen. The internode region shrinks with rupture of tissue in the root eye region and the spores are ejected from these spots. If the fungal spores enter the leaf sheath through the leaf midrib, then reddish spots can be seen on the backside of the leaf midrib also. The external symptoms appear only after16 - 21 days after infection and drying of entire cane takes another 10 days time. When the affected cane is split opened, the inner region is reddish in colour with intermittent white tinges across the cane length. If the variety is highly susceptible or disease incidence is severe, ash colour fungal growth is seen inside the cane. Sometimes, the pith inside the cane is filled with blackish brown liquid and exhibited alchohol odour. Identification of pathogen Red rot disease is caused by the fungus Glomerella tucumanensis. An older name, Colletotrichum falcatum, is still preferred by some pathologists. Pathogen present on leaf sheaths and blades, solitary or aggregated, often forming short lines between vascular bundles, globose, immersed, dark brown to black 65-250 µm diam.; wall up to 8 cells thick, sclerotia on outside, pseudoparenchymatous within, ostiole slightly papillate, circular. Management Cultural method: The red rot affected field must be rotated with rice for one season and other crops for two seasons. Growing of recommended resistant and moderately resistant varieties viz., Co 86249, CoSi 95071, CoG 93076, CoC 22, CoSi 6 and CoG 5 Physical method: Removal of the affected clumps at an early stage and soil drenching with Carbandazim 50 WP (1 gm in 1 litre of water) Chemical method: Adopt sett treatment with Carbendazim before planting (Carbendazim 50 WP (0.5 gm in 1 litre of water) or Carbendazim 25 DS (1gm in 1 litre of water) along with Urea (10 gm in 1 litre of water) for 5 minutes) Sett Rot When diseased setts are planted they may rot before germination, or the shoots may die after reaching a height of about 6-12 inches. As the setts get dried up, the reddish colour becomes black with lots of black coloured fungal spores adhering to it. If infected shoots survive, they are very much stunted and chlorotic. Eventually the leaves may wither and the shoots wilt. If the affected shoots and setts are examined the central portion of the shoots will be seen discoloured red and the contents of the sett rotting. When split opened, the affected setts exhibit pineapple odour. Identification of pathogen: Ceratocytis paradoxa were initially whitish, measuring about 5 mm in diameter. The colonies were turned black due to the production of chlamydospores, which are heavily pigmented, when mature. Management Cultural method: Proper drainage and planting of setts in 1-2 cm depth. Chemical method: Sett treatment with Carbendazim or bavistin before planting (Bavistin @ 1per cent or Carbendazim 50 WP @0.5 gm in 1 litre of water or Carbendazim 25 DS @ 1gm in 1 litre of water along with Urea @10 gm in 1 litre of water for 5 minutes) Pre treatment the setts with hot water has been found to stimulate germination of buds and hasten growth soa s to help the young plants to overcome the competition with the pathogen. Smut Symptoms Production of whip like structure of 25 – 150 cm. from the growing point of the canes. Whip covered by translucent silvery membrane enclosing mass of black powdery spores. Initial thin canes with elongated internodes later become reduced in length. Profuse sprouting of lateral buds with narrow, erect leaves especially in ratoon crop. Identification of pathogen Ustilago scitaminea The fungal mycelium spores are echinulate, light brown and spherical, measuring 6.5 – 8.5 µ in diameter. They germinate readily in water, producing 2-3 celled promycelia. sporidia arise terminally or laterally and they are hyaline, thin walled, single celled and elliptical to linear. Management Cultural method: Growing of resistant and moderately resistant varieties viz., Co 86249, CoG 93076, CoC 22, CoSi 6 and CoG 5 Discourage ratooning of the diseased crops having more than 10 per cent infection Cajanus cajan is grown as a companion crop between rows of sugarcane, the secondary spread of the disease is substantially reduced. Physical method: Treating the seed setts with Areated Steam Therapy (AST) at 50 ºC for 1 hour or in hot water at 50 ºC for 30 minutes or at 52 ºC for 18 minutes Roguing of smut whips with gunny bags/polythene bag and dipped in boiling water for 1 hour, and diseased clums must be uprooted and burnt Chemical method: Sett treatment with fungicides viz., Triadimefon @ 1gm in 1 litre of water or Carbendazim @ 1gm in 1 litre of water for 10 minutes. Wilt Symptoms: External: Gradual yellowing and drying of foliage, shrinkage/withering of canes. Internal: Light to dark purplish or brown discolouration of ground tissue, pithiness and boat shaped cavities in the middle of the internodes. Identification of Pathogen Conidiosphores usually erect and branched. Macroconidia abundant, falcate to rather straight, 3-5-septate, with a distinct foot-cell, 27-73 × 3.4-5.2 mm. Blastoconidia straight or slightly curved, 2-3-septate, fusiform to lanceolate, with a somewhat pointed, often slightly asymmetrical apical cell and a truncate basal cell, 16-43 × 3.0-4.5 mm. Management Cultural method: Healthy seed, sett treatment with fungicides, resistant varieties, crop rotation, managing root borer, avoiding prolonged drought and water logging and hygienic practices. Chemical Method: Dipping the setts in 40 ppm of boron or manganese, or spraying the plants with either of these minor elements reduces the disease intensity. Rust Sugarcane rust is mainly a disease of the leaf. The earliest symptoms are small, elongated yellowish spots that are visible on both leaf surfaces. The spots increase in length, turn brown to orange brown or red brown in color. Pustules, which produce spores, usually develop on the lower leaf surface. Identification of pathogen Puccinia erianthi Uredinia were elongate, reddish-brown, with capitate, hyaline to light brown paraphyses. Urediniospores were thick-walled, orange-brown, obovoid, measuring 26-34 x 16-20 µm. The urediniospore surface was echinulate with 4-5 equatorial pores. Teliospores were dark brown and measured 30-43 x 17-23 µm, clavate, two-celled and slightly constricted at the septum. Management Cultural method: Use resistant varieties like Co 91010 (Dhanush), Co 87025 (Kalyani) Chemical method: Spray Tridemorph 1.0 litres or Mancozeb 2.0 kg/ha. Grassy Shoot Disease Symptoms Initial symptom appears in the young crop of 3 – 4 months age as thin papery white young leaves at the top of the cane. Later, white or yellow tillers appear in large number below these leaves (profuse tillering). The cane becomes stunted with reduced internodal length. There is no millable cane formation. At times, one or two canes grow well in the affected tillers with greenish leaves. When these seemingly good canes are used for setts, the following crop produces only whitish leaves; these leaves dry early and gaps in the field. Mode of spread The disease is spread by the use of affected setts for planting. Also, the black hopper (Browtista moesta) acts as a carrying agent of this disease. Management Cultural method: Growing resistant varieties viz., Co 86249, CoG 93076 and CoC 22 Avoid ratooning if GSD incidence is more than 15 % in the plant crop Physical method: Rogue out infected plants in the secondary and commercial seed nursery. Treat setts with aerated steam at 50°C for 1 hour to control primary infection. Treating them with hot air at 540C for 8 hours and spraying twice a month with aphidicides. Chemical method Spray dimethoate @ 1ml in 1 litre of water to control insect vector Yellow Leaf Disease Symptom of Damage: Yellowing of midrib and adjacent laminar region and subsequent leaf drying along the mid rib in 3 to 5 leaves from top. In some cases reddish discolouration is also seen and in severe cases drying of spindle along with leaves. Pathogen: The virus is transmitted by aphids, Melanaphis sacchari and Rhopalosiphum maidis, in a semi-persistent manner. SCYLV is a member of the Luteoviridae family. The virus is localized within the phloem cells of the plant. Management Cultural method: Use healthy seed cane Field should be maintain with proper hygiene Application proper nutritional management and use resistant varieties. Chemical method: Secondary transmission of the disease by insect vectors can be controlled by application of Malathion(0.1%) or Dimecron(0.2%). Ratoon Stunting The affected plants are stunted, the stunting being most severe in stubble and ratoon crops. Infected stocks is the presence of pin head like orange coloured dots of bacteria on the internal soft tissue in the nodal region The setts taken from diseased plants germinate poorly and the few shoots that are emerge grow very slowly. It is sap-transmissible and no insect vector has been found. Pathogen The organism that causes RSD is, Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli, a small aerobic bacterium. The genus ofthe pathogen was previously called Clavibacter. Management Cultural method: Select healthy setts for planting. Mechanical method: Treat setts with hot water at 50°C for about 2 hours give 100 per cent control. Copyright © TNAU | All Rights Reserved

Harvesting either under-aged or over-aged cane with improper method of harvesting leads to loss in cane yield, sugar recovery, poor juice quality and problems in milling due to extraneous matter. Therefore, proper harvesting should ensure: To harvest the cane at peak maturity (i.e., avoiding cutting of either over-matured or under-matured cane) Cutting cane to ground level so that the bottom sugar rich internodes are harvested which add to yield and sugar De-topping at appropriate height so that the top immature internodes are eliminated Proper cleaning of the cane i.e., removing the extraneous matter such as leaves, trash, roots etc. Quick disposal of the harvested cane to factory Harvesting: Sugarcane matures in 10-12 month in North India and 18-20 month in South India. Brix value is 16-18 in Dec and Jan at or below 200 C. Different Indicators of harvesting are leaves become yellow, plants stops growing and arrows come out, cane produces metallic sounds, buds swell out and eyes start sprouting. Top of page Harvesting Schedule In India harvesting of sugarcane is carried out at 10 to 18 months stage, depending upon the planting time and crop maturity. In sub-tropics, autumn crop is harvested at 15 month stage, whereas spring and summer (late-planted) crops at 10-12 months. Early varieties are harvested at 10 months stage, mid-late 10-12 months and late after 12 month stage. In tropical zone adsali crop is harvested after 16-18 months stage. Types of harvesting Manual Harvesting Hand knives, cutting blade or hand axes are used for manual harvesting. It requires skilled labourers as improper harvest of cane leads to loss of cane and sugar yield, poor juice quality and problems in milling due to extraneous matter. Mechanical Harvesting Sugarcane is harvested by mechanical harvester which move along the rows of cane removing the leafy tops of the cane and cutting the stalk into short pieces or "billets". Billets are loaded into bins which are towed alongside the harvester. When full, the bins are taken by road or tramway to the sugar mill.The field capacity of mechanical cane harvesters varies with the size (2.5 to 4 ha per day of 8 hours. Top of page Maturity symptoms and Harvesting period Pre – harvest practices a. Apply cane ripeners Spray Sodium metasilicate 4 kg/ha in 750 litres of water on the foliage of crop at 6 months after planting. Ii.Repeat the same twice at 8th and 10th months to obtain higher cane yield and sugar percentage. b. Assessing maturity of crops Assess the maturity by hand refractometer brix survey and 18 to 20 per cent brix indicates optimum maturity for harvest. Top-bottom ratio of H.R.Brix reading should be 1:1. Harvesting Harvesting of sugarcane at a proper time i.e., peak maturity, by adopting right technique is necessary to realize maximum weight of the millable canes (thus sugar) produced with least possible field losses under the given growing environment. On the other hand harvesting either under-aged or over-aged cane with improper method of harvesting leads to loss in cane yield, sugar recovery, poor juice quality and problems in milling due to extraneous matter. Prevention of Moisture loss in the Harvested cane Covering the harvested cane with trash and sprinkling with water both under sun and shade reduced the moisture loss and prevented quality deterioration. Among the varieties studied, maximum loss of moisture (5.9%) was recorded by the variety Co 86249 while the varieties Co 94008 and Co 85019 have registered minimum loss of moisture (4.7%). Therefore, proper harvesting should ensure: To harvest the cane at peak maturity (i.e., avoiding cutting of either over-matured or under-matured cane) Early varieties have to be harvested at 10 to 11 months age and mid-season varieties at 11 to 12 months age. Cutting cane to ground level so that the bottom sugar rich internodes are harvested which add to yield and sugar De-topping at appropriate height so that the top immature internodes are eliminated Proper cleaning of the cane i.e., removing the extraneous matter such as leaves, trash, roots etc. Quick disposal of the harvested cane to factory Purity Percentage = (Sucrose %/HR Brix)100 A cane crop is considered fit for harvesting if it has attained a minimum of 16% sucrose and 85% purity. CCS (tons/ha) = [Yield (tons/ha) x Sugar Recovery (%)] /100 Sugar Recovery (%) = [S - 0.4 (B - S)] x 0.73 Where, S= Sucrose % in juice and B= Corrected Brix (%) Cane yield Cane yield = stalk number x single cane weight stalk number depends on Germination % Tillering capacity Percent cane formed shoots and their retention till harvest. Stalk weight depends on Length of cane Diameter of the cane. Harvesting should be aimed to realise maximum number of millable canes produced with least possible losses. Top of page General The integrated production strategies for harvesting the maximum cane yield includes Selection of suitable varieties specific to the locations Through land preparation Use of healthy nursery seed material Planting at proper season with suitable varieties Maintaining optimum plant population through adequate gap filling Application of appropriate herbicide combinations for effective control of the weeds Enrichment of the organic content of the soil by way of application of bulky organic manures or in situ incorporation of green manure crops. Application of correct dose of inorganic fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Need based micro nutrient can be applied. Use of bio fertilizers Especially Azospirillum, Acetobacter and Phosphobacteria Adoption of integrated pest and disease management stratagies Appropriate water management practices and especially adopting drip fertigation systems Harvesting at appropriate time and upto bottom of the cane using sharp knives. For Ratoon Collect the trash without burning Stubble shaving for obtaining uniform sprouting Shoulder breaking for loosening the soil compaction and cut the old roots Apply additionally 70 kg N/ha as basal to boost initial growth Ferrous sulphate can be sprayed (5 kg/ha) for correcting the Iron Chlorosis Top of page PROCESSING OF SUGARCANE Collecting the harvested cane Mature canes are gathered by a combination of manual and mechanical methods. Canes are cut at ground level, its leaves are removed and the top is trimmed off by cutting off the last mature joint. Cane is then placed into large piles and picked up, tied, and transported to a sugar factory. Prevention of moisture loss in the harvested cane Covering the harvested cane with trash and sprinkling with water both under sun and shade reduced the moisture loss and prevented quality deterioration. Cleaning and Crushing Stalks are thoroughly washed and cut when reaching the sugar mill. After the cleaning process, a machine led by a series of rotating knives, shreds the cane into pieces. This is known as "grinding." During grinding, hot water is sprayed on to the sugarcane to dissolve any remaining hard sugar. The smaller pieces of cane are then spread out on a conveyer belt. Juicing The shredded pieces of sugarcane travel on the conveyer belt through a series of heavy-duty rollers, which extract juice from the pulp. The pulp that remains or "bagasse" is dried and used as fuel. The raw juice moves on through the mill to be clarified. Clarifying Carbon dioxide and the milk of a lime are added to the liquid sugar mixture and it is heated to the boiling point, as the process of clarifying begins. As the carbon dioxide travels through the liquid it forms calcium carbonate, which attracts non-sugar debris (fats, gums, and wax) from the juice, and pulls them away from the sugar juice. The juice is then pushed through a series of filters to remove any remaining impurities. Evaporation The clear juice which results from the clarifying process is put under a vacuum, where the juice boils at a low temperature and begins to evaporate. It is heated until it forms into thick, brown syrup. Crystallization By evaporating what little water is left in the sugar syrup, crystallization takes place. Inside a sterilized vacuum pan, pulverized sugar is fed into the pan as the liquid evaporates, causing the formation of crystals. The remaining mixture is a thick mass of large crystals, which is sent to a centrifuge to spin and dry the crystals. The dried product is raw sugar, still inedible. Refinery Raw sugar is transported to a Cane Sugar Refinery for the removal molasses, minerals and other non-sugars, which still contaminate the sugar. This is known as the purification process. Raw sugar is mixed with a solution of sugar and water to loosen the molasses from the outside of the raw sugar crystals, producing a thick matter known as "magma." Large machines then spin the magma, which separate the molasses from the crystals. Crystals are promptly washed, dissolved and filtered to remove impurities. The golden syrup which is produced is then sent through filters to remove the color and water. What's left is concentrated, clear syrup, which is again fed into a vacuum pan. Separation and Packaging Once the final evaporation and drying process is done, screens separate the different sized sugar crystals. Large and small crystals are packaged and shipped, labeled as white, refined sugar. Sugar Facts Refined white sugar is 99.9-percent sucrose. White sugar is pure sucrose, containing no preservatives or additives.

The juice is clarified with lime and subsequently concentrated to produce massecuites which is a mixture of crystals and surrounding dense, dark brown liquid called molasses. The crystals (raw sugar) are separated from the molasses by centrifugation. Refined sugar is purified white sugar of approximately 99.50 pol, a moisture content of around 0.03% and an colour of less than 45. Sugarcane Juice The sugarcane variety for juice should give high in juice extraction and have high sugar content. Some of the varieties which are ideally suited for bottling of juice are CoC 671, Co 62175, Co 7717, Co 86032 and Co94012. The canes should be cleaned free of roots at the nodes and adhering soil particles. It is preferable to remove the rind portion of the cane by suitable means as the pigments present in the rind contribute to dark colour and unpleasant taste to the juice. The canes should be crushed in clean power operated crusher (preferably with stainless steel rollers) Then juice collected after filtration through muslin cloth into a clean sterilized stainless steel vessel. One medium sized lemon and 2-3g of ginger can be added for every 3kg of cane while the canes are crushed. Gur or Jaggery The result of the milling process is pure whole unrefined non-centrifugal cane sugar, called Panela (right). The earliest modern record of Panela is around 3000BC in India, where Panela was known as Gur Jaggery, or more commonly today Gur, or 'poor people’s sugar'. Procedure for Preparation of jaggery: 1. Fresh sugarcanes are cut from the fields, canes are cut in such a way that the head and tail are chopped off. They are carefully brought in a plastic sack, to the place where they are made juice. 2. To extract juice from the sugarcane, they use a small power run machine, where at one side four or five canes are fed, and at the other end, extracted sugar cane juice is directly feed to the vessel. 3. Next step involved is boiling the extracted juice, juice is feed to a large big iron vessel, which is usually called as kadai. Molasses Molasses is a viscous byproduct of the processing of sugar cane. To make molasses, the sugar cane juice is extracted from the canes, usually by crushing or mashing; it can also be removed by cutting. The juice is boiled to concentrate it, which promotes the crystallization of the sugar. The result of this first boiling and removal of the sugar crystals is first molasses, which has the highest sugar content because comparatively little sugar has been extracted from the source. Second molasses is created from a second boiling and sugar extraction, and has a slight bitter tinge to its taste. The third boiling of the sugar syrup makes blackstrap molasses. The majority of sucrose from the original juice has been crystallized, but blackstrap molasses is still mostly sugar by calories. However, unlike refined sugars, it contains significant amounts of vitamins and minerals. Blackstrap molasses is a source of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron; one tablespoon provides up to 20% of the daily value of each of those nutrients. Blackstrap, often sold as a health supplement, is also used in the manufacture of cattle feed and for other industrial uses. Bagasse The bagasse (or the crushed cane fibres), which results from the milling, is used in the boilers for steam production which is used to power the process. The surplus bagasse is used in industry, to produce power, make paper, building materials, as a fuel and even as stock feeds. Ethanol Sugarcane can also be used to make ethanol, a liquid that can be used as an automotive fuel or a gasoline additive. Sugarcane is an excellent feedstock because the biomass of the sugarcane plant is relatively rich in the sugar that can be readily turned into fuel. Brazil is the world’s leading producer of sugarcane ethanol and it is estimated that upward of 40% of Brazil’s transportation energy needs are met by sugar cane ethanol. Syrup Sugar cane syrup is athick syrup that is created by evaporating the juice extracted from sections of sugar cane. The preparation of this type of cane syrup usually involves boiling the juice for several hours, and making sure to skim the surface of the juice throughout the process. When prepared properly, this approach yields a thick syrup that is extremely sweet, making it ideal for use in both home cooking and the preparation of commercial foods Candy Candy is a type of confectionery mineral composed of relatively large sugar crystals. The candy is formed by allowing a supersaturated solution of sugar and water to crystallize onto a surface suitable for crystal nucleation, such as a string or stick. Heating the water before adding the sugar allows more sugar to dissolve and thus produces larger crystals. Crystals form after 6–7 days. Food coloring may be added to the mixture to produce colored candy. Rum Rum is a distilled beverage made from sugarcane by products such as molasses and sugarcane juice by a process of fermentation and distillation. The distillate, a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak and other barrels Filter cake or mud press Filter cake or mud press is a chocolate, sticky waste during juice extraction of cane stalks containing 5-15 % protein, calcium and phosphorus; 5-15 % sugar; 10-30% fiber; 10-20% ash and other micronutrients. It is a by-product with high potential as important component of organic fertilizer and animal feed and as source of sugarcane wax and methane (gas for fuel) when process. Top of page Yeast Yeasts are complex, protein-rich, living unicellular organisms that have been selected and isolated through research, Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce baker's yeast. It is normally produced from molasses. About 4 kg of molasses would be required to produce 1 kg of active dry baker's yeast (92 percent dry matter). Yeast is used in bread production at about 1 percent by weight of flour. On a dry matter basis, it contains about 44 percent protein Confectionary Sugar confectionery refers to a large range of food items, commonly known as sweets. Boiled sweets, toffees, marshmallows, and fondant are all examples. Today, sugar confectionery includes a large range of food items, commonly known as sweets. Some examples are; Boiled sweets, Toffees, and Marshmallows. Sugarcane Tops Sugarcane tops are a major by-product of the sugarcane industry which is left in the field after harvest and widely used for feeding draught animals or cattle owned by workers on the sugar estates or by the sugar companies. The tops, or leaves from sugarcane are mostly fed to large ruminants and so do not normally constitute a feed resource for small stock. Top of page Copyright © TNAU | All Rights Reserved

No producer/importer/exporter of sugar can sell/dispose of/deliver any kind of sugar except under and in accordance with the direction issued by the Government. The profitability of sugar mills is affected by the ratio of free sale quota to levy quota. Though this ratio has been considerably reduced to 10:90, the sale of free sugar is subject to monthly release system. Sugarcane alone accounts for 60 per cent of the cost of sugar production. Though the Central Government fixes the Statutory Minimum Price (SMP) for sugarcane, the mills have to procure sugarcane at State Advice Prices (SAPs) fixed by the State governments. As the SAPs are invariably higher than the SMP, it affects the viability of processing. There is a visible difference in the plant size and operational efficiency of the mills in the private and the co-operative sector. To achieve operational efficiency, availability of sugarcane is required throughout the season and requires proper management of raw material. It is however, difficult to ensure owing to farmers harvesting more than the quantity ordered to clear their fields or diverting cane to gur/khandsari units. Top of page Transport of Cane Organising an efficient cane transport system is of paramount importance, so that the cane is delivered at required quantity within 24 hours. Optimum economic distance for cane transport ranges from 10 to 26 km. Cane price and Payment The price for the sugarcane supplied to the sugar factory is fixed by the local state governments based on the cost of cultivation and other factors and the price is linked to the sugar recovery. The Tamil Nadu State Government has recently (year 2009-2010) fixed a price of Rs.1, 550 per tonne of cane with 9.5 percent sugar recovery. The sugar factories make payment to the registered cane growers through banks. Top of page Sugar Mills And Factories Tamil Nadu Co.op Sugar Mills and Factories Ambur Coop.

Top of page Cultivation Practices How to prepare a wetland for cultivating sugarcane after harvesting paddy? In wetlands, preparatory cultivation by ploughing the land and bringing the soil to fine tilth could not be done. i) After harvest of the paddy crop, form irrigation and drainage channels of 40 cm depth and 30 cm width at intervals of 6 m across the field and along the field borders. ii) Form ridges and furrows with a spacing of 80 cm between rows with spade. iii) Stir the furrows with hand hoes and allow the soil to weather for 4 to 5 days. What type of soil is suitable for growing sugarcane? Sugarcane can be grown in all types of soils ranging from Sandy loam to Clay loam soils. How can we conserve our soil fertility? Integrated management with organic manure and inorganic fertilizers. How much soil organic matter is necessary for higher sugarcane yield? 2-3% soil organic matter. What are the measurements to create ridges and furrows in case of problem soil before cultivating the sugarcane? In problem soils, with excessive moisture where it is difficult to drain water, form raised beds at 30cm intervals with Length - 5 m, Width - 80 cm, and Height -15 cm. What are the proportions in which the organic manure has to be applied to a field inorder to cultivate sugarcane?  Apply FYM at 12.5 t/ha or compost 25 t/ha or filter press mud at 37.5 t/ha before the last ploughing under gardenland conditions. In wetlands this may be applied along the furrows and Incorporated well.  Test the soil and apply P fertilizer based on soil test values. Otherwise apply superphosphate (375 kg/ha) along the furrows and incorporate with hand hoe.  Apply 37.5 kg Zinc sulphate/ha and 100 kg Ferrous sulphate/ha to zinc and iron deficient soils. What size of pits can be made to plant sugarcane? Or How to prepare pits for sugarcane planting? Pit to pit spacing- 1.5 1.5 m, number of pits/ha- 4,444 pits, pit diameter  0.9 m, Pit depth  0.38 m, number of budded setts / pit  32 (Single budded setts) or 16 number of single budded setts. How to plant sugarcane in pit method after pit preparation? Fill the pits to a depth of 15 cm with compost and native soil and mix it well. Place the healthy setts in circular fashion leaving 10 cm from the outer boundary of the pits with equal spacing between each setts and cover the setts with the soil. On 50 to 60 days after planting give partial earthing up by sliding the soil from the outer boundary of the pit and full earthing up should be given leaving a depression of 2.5 cm from the ground level at 90 to 100 days after planting. When to use fertilizer after transplantation of sugarcane settlings? Within 7 to 14 days. What is the recommended fertilizer dose for the pith method of sugarcane planting? Fertilizer dose- 275:62.5:112.5 kg NPK/ha  The entire phosphorous dose can be applied as basal at the time of planting.  The nitrogen and potassium as urea and MOP (White potash) should be applied through fertigation system in 14 equal splits starting from 15 DAP upto 210 DAP. How can we satisfy higher nutritional demand of sugarcane? Ensure application of balanced fertilization with recommended doses of fertilizers. What is dual row planting method of sugarcane? What is its advantage? To facilitate mechanization and to improve the cane yield under wide rows, a new technology, 'dual row planting' is developed. In this method, broad furrows are formed at a spacing of 150 cm and in the middle of the furrows sugarcane setts are planted in two rows adopting a spacing of 30 cm between them. The dual row system of gave planting cane yield of 136.3 t/ha and the highest variety Co 94005 recorded the highest cane yield under dual row planting. What are the benefits of paired row cultivation? Two grow more than one intercrop, to earn more income within the same land and to generate more scope of utilizing labour force. What is the Spaced transplanting method? Recently in STP (Spaced transplanting) method single eyed sets are used for planting. Either direct sets or seedlings raised in polybag nurseries are transplanted into the field after 50-55 days. For this STP or single eyed set method 750-1MT seed per acre is required. This method saves seed cost by 60-70%. In this method distance between two sets kept at 30cm. Which are improved methods of sugarcane planting? Different improved methods of sugarcane planting are: Ridge-furrow, flat, trench, double row, ring pit, Spaced Transplanting (STP), Poly bag What is technology detail of ring-pit method? About 7600 pits/ha of 90/75 cm diameter and 45 cm deep are made by tractor mounted pit-digger machine. Twenty 2 budded treated setts are arranged horizontally in cyclic manner in each pit partially filled with mixture of 5 kg FYM, 45 gm DAP, 45 gm Urea and some part of soil, then followed by spray of chlorpyriphos 20% EC @ 5 liters/ha On setts, soil cover up to 2.5 cm above setts and light irrigation. Half of the excavated out soil with 25 gm urea is filled back in each pit in the month of March/April, remaining half of the soil is placed in pit with 25 gm urea and 4.5 gm Phorate 10 G by the end of June. Which method of planting is suitable for late conditions? Under late planting condition 25000-30000 STP raised settlings are transplanted in one hectare land maintaining 75 cm row spacing and 60 cm plant to plant spacing leaving 5 cm of shoot above ground level followed by irrigation. What is Chip-bud technique? In this technique the bud along with a portion of the nodal region is chipped off using a bud chipping machine. This bud is used for planting. What are the advantages in tissue culture of sugarcane?  Production of true to type plantlets  Rapid multiplication  Independent of seasonal constraints  Maintaining and improving the productivity of outstanding varieties in the field  Production of disease free planting material from apical meristem Within how many days gap filling was done? Fill the gaps, if any, within 30 days after planting with sprouted setts. What is trash mulching Mulch the ridges uniformly with cane trash to a thickness of 10 cm within a week after planting. It helps to tide over drought, conserves moisture, reduce weed population and minimise shoot borer incidence. Mulch the field with trash after 21 days of planting in heavy soil and wetland conditions. Avoid trash mulching in areas where incidence of termites is noticed. What are the possible intercrops for sugarcane? In areas of adequate irrigation, sow one row of soybean or blackgram or greengram can be used. Intercropping of daincha or sunhemp along ridges and incorporation of the same on the 45th day during partial earthing up helps to increase the soil fertility, and also the cane yield. Especially Intercropping of Co.1 Soybean gives a yield of 800 kg/ha without any adverse effect on cane yield. What are the non flowering varieties of sugarcane? Non-flowering varieties are Co 8021, Co 86032, Co 87025, Co 91010, Co 94005 and Co 94008. How to control flowering in sugarcane?  Ethephon (ethrel) applied at the rate of 500 ppm effectively controlled flowering in a number of profuse flowering varieties.  By altering the planting date, flowering can be avoided in heavy flowering areas. Adsali planting or special season planting (July to September) helps in avoiding flowering and its adverse effects. What are the benefits of detrashing sugarcane? It increases sugar recovery by reducing insect & disease pests. Recommend the suitable intercrops in sugarcane? Soyabean, blackgram, greengram and cowpea are suitable for intercropping with sugarcane Top of page Nursery Preparation What is the seed rate for cultivating sugar cane? Azospirillum: Prepare the slurry with 10 packets (2000 g)/ha of Azospirillum inoculums with sufficient water and soak the setts in the slurry for 15minutes before planting. Fungicide: The setts should be soaked in Carbendazim (1 gram in 1 litre of water) What is the seed rate for cultivating sugar cane? 75,000 two-budded setts/ha. 40,000 three-budded setts/ha. What are the essential qualities of good seed of sugarcane? Straight and standing, no side shooting, should be certified with good germination capability and free of insect & diseases. What is the rate of planting sugarcane setts in a row?  Plant the setts accommodating 12 buds/metre length  Plant more setts near the channel or double row planting at every 10th row for gap filling, at later stage. What is the spacing for planting sugarcane setts ? i) Ridges and furrows - 80 cm between rows ii) Dual row planting - 150 cm between two broad furrows (middle of the furrows sugarcane setts are planted in two rows adopting a spacing of 30 cm between them) iii) Pit method of planting - Pit to pit spacing- 150 cm 150 cm. What are the seasons for raising sugarcane nursery and planting in the main field? Raise six to seven months old nursery crop prior to main field planting as follows: Raise nursery crop during Main field planting June December - January (early season) July February - March (Mid season) August April - May (Late season) Dec – Apr June - September (Special season) Top of page Nutrient Management What is the fertilizer dose to be used in nursery plot for sugarcane?

Sulphinated Press-Mud Cake (SPMC) @ 10 t/ha is evenly spread in the field and mixed with soil at last ploughing before sugarcane planting. Please inform about the symptoms of zinc deficiency in sugarcane and measures for its amelioration. Leaves of the middle portion of the cane become yellow in case of zinc deficiency. Yellowing starts from the tips of the leaves and proceeds towards the base of the leaves. In accute deficiency the leaves dry up. Zinc Sulphate (0.5%) + Urea (2.5%) or Zinc Sulphate (0.5%) + lime water are sprayed for its amelioration. What is the role of nitrogen in sugarcane cultivation?  Influences sugarcane yield and quality.  Required for vegetative growth (tillering, foliage formation, stalk formation and growth) and root growth.  Vegetative growth in sugarcane is directly related to yield. In what way phosphorus is useful to sugarcane?  Uptake depends on presence of soluble and plant absorbable form.  P- requirement is relatively less than N and K.  Necessary for formation of proteins and thus for yield build up.  Important for cell division leads to crop growth  Stimulates root growth  Necessary for plant metabolism and photo synthesis  Required for adequate tillering  Interacts with N and thus enhance ripening. What is the role of potassium in sugarcane cultivation?  Requirement of K is greater than N and P.  Required for carbon assimilation, photo synthesis translocation of carbohydrates  Involved in various enzymatic activities  Important for sugar synthesis and translocation to the storage organs.  Develops resistance to sugarcane against pest, disease and lodging.  Maintains cell turgidity under moisture stress conditions.  Balances the effect of N and P What is recommended dose of bio-fertilizer use in sugarcane. Acetobacter culture @ 12 kg/ha mixed with 125 kg FYM is applied over setts in forrows at the time of planting. Top of page Irrigation Management How many irrigations are necessary for sugarcane? 3 to 5. What are the irrigation intervals in each phase of sugarcane that must be given? The irrigation intervals in each phase are given below: Stages Days of irrigation interval Sandy soil Clay Soil Tillering phase (36 to 100 days) 8 10 Grand growth phase (101 - 270 days) 8 10 Maturity phase (271 – harvest) 10 14 What is fertigation system?  Fertigation is the judicious application of fertilizers by combining with irrigation water.  Fertigation can be achieved through fertilizer tank, venturi System, Injector Pump, Non-Electric Proportional Liquid Dispenser (NEPLD) and automated system.  For fertigation recommended dose of NPK is 275:15:112.5 NPK / ha in sugarcane fields What is surface drip irrigation? The application of water to the soil surface as drops or a tiny stream through emitters placed at predetermined distance along the drip lateral is termed as surface drip irrigation. It can be of two types - online or integral type surface drip system. Integral dripline is recommended for sugarcane. What is sub surface drip irrigation? The application of water below the soil surface through emitters molded on the inner wall of the dripline, with discharge rates (1.0 - 3.0 LPH) generally in the same range as integral surface drip irrigation. This method of water application is different from and not to be confused with the method where the root zone is irrigated by water table control, herein referred to as subirrigation. The integral dripline (thin or thick-walled) is installed at some predetermined depth in the soil depending on the soil type and crop requirements. There are two main types of SDI - "one crop" and "multicrop". Top of page Weed Management How many days of sugarcane field should be maintain weed free? 120 to 135 days. How to control parastitic weed striga in sugarcane field? If the parasitic weed striga is a problem, post-emergence application of 2,4-D sodium salt @ 1.25 kg/ha in 500 litre of water/ha may be done. 2, 4-D spraying should be avoided when neighboring crop is cotton or bhendi. Apply 20% urea also for the control of striga as direct spray. How to manage weeds in sugarcane field with intercropping system? Premergence application of Thiobencarb @ 1.25 kg ai/ha under intercropping system in Sugarcane with Soybean, blackgram or groundnut gives effective weed control. Raising intercrops is not found to affect the cane yield and quality. Suggest the herbicides suitable for control of weeds in sugarcane? Pre-emergence application (Before the emergence of weeds) of Atrazine 2kg a.i. / acre mixed with 80 - 100 l of water within 3 days after planting while spraying these herbicides soil should contain optimum moisture. Gramoxone 1 l / acre mixed with 80 - 100 l of water should spray 8 - 12 days after planting that is just before the emergence of sugarcane. To control the sedges and broad leaved weeds apply gramoxone 1 litre + Fernoxone 1kg / acre . Dilute these herbicides separately in water mixed in tank while spraying. What is the Pre-emergence weed management? Protect the sugarcane crop without weeds for 90 days from planting onwards. During 3rd or 4th day after planting spray Atrazine @ 2.5 kg/ha uniformly on the surface of field before the emergence of weeds. Chemical should be diluted in 1000liter of water and spray through hand sprayer. Separate hand sprayer and nossel should be used for herbicide application. Before application of fertilizer, weeds which are not controlled by herbicide application should be uprooted by hand weeding. By this method we can reduce the maximum level of crop damage. What is post-emergence weed management? After the emergence of weeds, spray 2-4-D @ 2.5kg/ha to control broad leaves weed. Grass sp are controlled by hand weeding. Spraying of Ethoxy sulfuron @ 13kg/10 litre of water controls the Cyprus sp. Top of page Pest And Disease What are the major beneficiary insects of sugarcane? a) Trichogramma chilonis Ishii b) Telenomus dignoides Nixon What are the sucking pests of sugarcane prevalent in the regions of TamilNadu? White fly, scale insects, woolly aphid, mealy bugs, leaf hoppers are wide spread in epidemic and endemic forms in certain localities of Tamil Nadu. Which is the serious pest of sugarcane in Tamilnadu region? White grub is a major pest in the northern and western districts of Tamil Nadu. The damage in the ratoon crop is more severe than in the plant crop. The grubs live in the soil and feed on the root portion of the plant, causing wilting and drying of the canes in the latter date. When there is severe infestation entire crop is lost. Which are the serious diseases of sugarcane prevalent in regions of Tamilnadu? Red rot is the major serious disease of sugarcane. Smut is the major disease of sugarcane in Tamil Nadu causing severe economic loss next only to red rot. Early Shoot Borer What is the chemical control measure for early shoot borer? When an ETL (Economic Threshold Level) of 15% dead heart is reached apply any one of the following insecticides:  Soil application: Lindane10G 12.5 kg (or) Carbofuran3G 33 kg (or)Chlorpyriphos10G 12.5 Kg/ha  Spraying: Monocrotophos 36 WSC 1000 ml (or) Chlorpyriphos 20 EC 1000 ml (or) Phosalone 35 EC 1000 ml  Newer chemical against sugarcane shoot borer: Regent 3G @ 75g a.i/ha is found to be effective against shoot borer. Why should not power sprayer is used for applying insecticides for shoot borer control? For effective control of shoot borer, the insecticide should cover the site targeted by shoot borer in the plant which is the inner of the leaf sheath and collar region of the shoots. To cover such an area in each and every shoot, only high volume sprayers will be of use as the spray fluid can be directed precisely to the target region of each and every shoot. Moreover, the quantity of spray fluid to be used for the given length of row can be achieved correctly. Power sprayer is more suitable for foliage feeding pests. Is not Sevidol 8G effective against shoot borer? Granular insecticides, in general, can only give less coverage to target parts of plants than EC formulations for contact action. Moreover application of granules on leaf whorls of very small shoots numbering about one lakh in an acre is extremely difficult. More so, because sand is to be used as diluents with the granules, due to improper mixing of granules and sand, many a time shoots will receive no granule or sublethal dose only. Further, the slight fumigant action of carbaryl as fumigants will not be effective in the open and the slight systemic action of gamma sevidol is not of any consequence as even the fully systemic Furadon or Temik are not effective against shoot borer. Also, using a combination insecticide like sevidol is unscientific as it would render both insecticides useless due to development of cross resistance. Also, one of the components of Sevidol, viz gamma BHC is already banned by the government. Why is not shoot borer controlled even after the application of lindane or chlorpyriphos? If the application procedure described earlier is followed it will certainly give control of the borer. Further, dead heart formation by shoot borer takes a few days to a few weeks depending on the instar attacking the shoot, age of the shoot, prevailing weather and varietal ability. So, if new dead hearts are noticed even after the insecticidal application, they would have been the shoots already damaged by the borer and were in the process of drying at the time of insecticide application. What are the control measures other than insecticide for shoot borer? Frequent irrigation and deployment of pheromone traps. Shoot borer attack kills the shot which would naturally induce formation of compensatory shoots. If irrigation is given, the formation and growth of compensatory shoots are encouraged. In fields where frequent irrigation is not possible compensatory shoots will not be formed and the infested parts of the fields will remain gappy Spray Granulosis virus at 1.5 x 1012 PIB/ha twice on 35 and 50 days after planting (DAP) or release 125 gravid females of Sturmiopsis inferens /ha on 30 and 45 DAP. What are the pheromone traps? Pheromone traps are an important device in early pest warning system to detect presence of insects in fields and give an indication to initiating pest control measures with appropriate insecticides or biological control agents at the right time. Pheromone traps are lures that contains the female hormones to attract the male insects. When pheromone lure is placed in dispenser and kept in the trap, pheromone from dispenser gradually evaporates and spreads in air by diffusion process. Male species of insects receives the smell of pheromones and get attracted to the lures, which serve as female trap, and male insects eventually get trapped. Insecticides with knock down and fumigation effect, such as dichlorvos, kerosene and diesel are used to kill trapped males, which might have otherwise mated with females to produce innumerable eggs. Once the insect enters the trap, it will not be able to come out. Where from the pheromone traps could be obtained? The Rajshree sugars and Chemicals Ltd., Varadharaj nagar,Vaigai dam, 625 562, Theni and Pest control India Ltd., Bangalore are producing the pheromones. The former firm recommends eight traps per acre while the latter recommends four per acre. But 10 traps per acre, 45cm trap height and weekly filling of water and kerosene in the trap are essential for the method to be effective against shoot borer. Can we use the same pheromone for any pest? We can use the same trap for any pest but not the same pheromone lure. Each species has different pheromones and hence only specific ones are to be used. There is no special smell in the rubber septa supplied by the firms? How to find out they are genuine? The smell will be known only to the individuals of the particular insect species and even the other pest species will not be able to identify it. From the collection of months in the traps the genuineness of the septa can be ascertained provided there is moth emergence when deployed. What are the side effects of pheromones? No side effects at all at the quantity of 3mg used in a lure. On the other hand it has same advantages that are not there even in biological control or in resistant varieties. In fields set with pheromone traps for internode borer, its attack was more while the adjacent fields where pheromone traps were not set was having less INB. Could the reason be that moths are attracted from that field to our fields? Not possible. When moths can get attracted from adjacent fields it is more probable for the more attraction in pheromone deployed field itself. Suppose the maintenance of pheromone traps is poor in deployed field, the moths attracted from adjacent fields will not be killed and so the population of the moth in the pheromone deployed field will rise which could have increased the incidence? No. The attracted moths are only males and females. So even if they were not killed they cannot lay eggs and also the females once mated with the local males will not mate again. So there is no possibility of increase in pest incidence. Will trash mulching reduce shoot borer incidence? Yes. The trash acts as mechanical barrier to the tiny and just emerged shoot borer larvae which have to move from one clump to another only through the soil surface as leaves of adjacent clumps will not touch each other during that age of crop. Moreover, the trash will encourage development of general predators such as spiders, carabid beetles etc which increase chances of predation of the moths and the dispersing larvae. However, the possibility of cut worm or rat damage in mulched fields is more. A light earthing up on 35th day will reduce shoot borer incidence? No. It will not because, the larvae are so tiny that they can find their way to the lower part of the shoot below the soil in the gaps present in between the leaf sheaths and the shoots which can never be covered by any amount of earthing up. The dead shoots of plants have a lot of small white larvae. Are they the causative agents? No. Shoot borer larvae are big and only one and rarely two will be present in a shoot. Several tiny larvae seen in dead shoots are saprophytic maggots that develop on decaying plant matter and never be able to attack a plant. If you want to collect shoot borer larvae, select the shoots showing wilting of spindle (and not dried ones) which will have shoot borer larva. Internode Borer What pest attacks the internode portion of sugarcane reducing its quality ultimately? Internode borer affects the crop from 4th month stage onwards up to harvest. The pest affects the nodal portions of the crop and conspicuous by their bore holes. Affected crop exhibits nodal sproutings and frass material inside the tunnels. How do Internode borer enter and get effect the Sugarcane crop? Caterpillars bore at the nodal region and enter the stem. Its feeding makes the tissues red. Entrance hole is usually plugged with excreta .A single larva may attack a number of nodes. How to control the internode borer in sugarcane?  Release egg parasitoid, Trichogramma chilonis at the rate of 2.5 cc/release/ha. Six releases 15 days interval starting from 4th month onwards will be necessary. During rainy weather and when ants are present, release the parasite through mosquito net covered plastic disposable cups.  Detrash the crop on the 150th and 210th day after planting. What is the possible cause for the presence of dead heart in sugarcane? Top borer, a serious pest of sugarcane creates dead heart condition. Its incidence is seen from 6th month stage onwards. The affected cane exhibits dead heart in central whorl leaf which cannot be pulled out easily. Sprouting of top buds in cluster renders a bunch top appearance in the plant. More than the yield, sugar recovery loss is more pronounced in crops damaged by top borer. Even after Trichogramma chilonis release the dead heart formation by INB is not reduce. Why? Trichogramma chilonis is not an efficient parasitoid to control INB. So, T.chilonis release may be dispensed with for INB management. Can detrashing be effective for INB management? Not as a sole method. That is detrashing alone may contribute to only 2 to 4% reduction in incidence. Are pheromones effective for INB management? Of the available methods this gives better results, provided, the number of traps is set at 25 per hectare, traps are set at 90 to 120 cm height, deployed on 5th month of the crop, water and kerosene/diesel level is maintained at weekly interval without fail and the lures are changed once in 45 to 50 days. In addition, the quality of pheromone lure supplied and the method of storage of spare lure by the supplied and the method of storage of spare lure by the farmer governs the efficacy. Even if any one of the aspects is not met with, the control will not be achieved. Since only male moths are attracted to the traps it will not be of any use? Why not we attract the female moths also? Reproduction of an insect is by mating of male and female moths. In nature for INB the male and female ratio is 50:50. Also, a female mate only once in its life span of 8-10 days. So, it is sufficient that any one sex is destroyed. Since in nature only female moths produce the pheromone it can be exploited economically to our advantage. When already mated male moths are attracted to the pheromone traps how the trap will be effective? Unlike the female moths of INB, a male moth is able to impregnate one fresh female daily for up to 4 to 6 days in its average life span of 7 days. Thus, males caught on any day prevent subsequent mating with fresh females. So when a male moth is trapped its subsequent mating is prevented. Sooner they are caught, the better would be the control and so timely deployment of trap and proper maintenance of trap is essential. Why is INB attack increasing more nowadays? Previously INB confined its attack the formative internode and did not produce dead hearts. So farmers will not know the INB attack unless they detrash the cane. However, INB has changed its mode of attack since 1989 wherein it destroys the meristem and causes dead hearts and bunchy top similar to that of top borer damage. This symptom is very glaring and eye catching. Besides, the variety Co 86032 is highly susceptible particularly to meristem damage when the crop is 7 months onwards. Since this variety is grown in 80% of Tamil Nadu almost all sugarcane growers have become aware of such damage. What is the control for the top borer pest? Release Isotima javensis at 100 pairs/ha or Trichogramma japonicum @ 2.5 CC/ha four to six times at fortnightly intervals from the onset of symptoms. How do Top shoot borer enter and affect the crop? Caterpillars damage the cane beyond 3 months age. Larva first tunnels into the mid rib of leaves, leaving red marking, usually in the second to fifth leaf from the top. As a result of biting across the spindle, a number of shot holes are formed in the leaf. Larva enters the cane and damages the growing point and feeds on internal tissues, side shoots develop and give rise to a "bunchy top". Dead heart when formed is reddish brown, appears charred, and can not be easily pulled out Which seasons does this Top shoot borer effect the crop? Activity of the top shoot borer starts with the onset of the monsoon rains. How to differentiate the INB and top borer dead hearts? In INB dead the spindle leaves and one or two leaves below will dry. In top borer dead hearts inner most leaf alone will dry. INB dead hearts will be very prominent and straw coloured and when pulled will slide from the spindle and come away. The lower part will show the drying symptom, discolouration and some time saprophytic maggots. In top borer dead hearts the colour will be generally dark brown, small in size, may or may not have feeding puncture holes and when pulled will snap and a part of dry leaf will come. The immediate green leaves may show shoot holes of one or two rows and the lower green leaf may show the mid tunneling. This is the most distinguishing symptom. Termites Will termite attack be more in light soils? Not necessarily. There are 13 species of termites in sugarcane. Some will be in light soil and some in heavy soil. So attack can be in any soil type. Will the termite be controlled if irrigated? No. Irrigation temporarily stops termite attack due to excess moisture and when the optimum moisture level is reached the attack will revive. How to prevent sugarcane against termite? Application of chlorpyriphos @ 5 lit/ha with 1500-1800 lit water in the furrow during planting controls termite in Sugarcane. Even if termite mounds are not there in the vicinity termite attack is seen in the field? Of the 13 species of termite in sugarcane not all form above ground mounds. Five species form below ground mounds and hence will not be visible. How should termite mounds be eradicated? Toss one celphos tablet and plug all the holes with mud. If the mounds are without chimneys a hole is made, celphos tablet tossed in and the hole plugged. Will mixing of used engine oil or kerosene in irrigation water give protection against termites? No.Termite attack will be patches here and there. The oil mixed with irrigation water will not spread uniformly to all places and required quantity of oil cannot be mixed to cover a large area. But though applying of engine oil on termite affected spots will certainly control will be temporary and the oil will spoil the structure which is more damaging than termite attack. Scale Insects What is the control measure for scale insect? Scale is not a serious pest to take up control measures. The feeding by scale is from the storage cell that contains sugar. It may use negligible amount of sugar for its development and so the damage is not sever. Because, the dead remains of the scale insect continue to stick to the internodes till harvest it will give an illusion of severe infestation of entire cane at the given time but in fact the encrustation has built up over several months. Any contact insecticides such as dichlorvos etc. When applied to the infested cane stalk after detrashing will only kill matured scales as young ones would have already settled on tender internodes that are covered by understandable leaf sheaths from which the infestation will continue. What insecticide is best for sett treatment against scale insect? If the setts are to be planted in situ there is no need for sett treatment with any insecticide as scale cannot develop on setts below the soil for four months till internodes are formed. However, if the setts are to be taken from infested place to new areas for planting such setts may be dipped in dichlovos at 1ml per lit water and placed in cement bags with the mouth tied and transported. The quick acting Nuvan with fumigant action will effectively kill the scale population on the setts. Mealy Bugs How to control mealy bug infestation in sugarcane?  Mealy bug is another minor pest and dose not causes any appreciable loss.  Detrashing will help to minimize the incidence.  Apply any one of the following insecticides when the incidence is noticed spray on the stem only: Methyl parathion 50 EC 1000 ml (or) Malathion 50 EC 1000 ml. How do the Mealybug Pest effect the Sugarcane Juice? Nymphs and adults suck sap and reduce the vitality of the crop; excrete honey dew on which sooty mould grow, due to which internodes appear black, and cane growth is retarded. Wooly Aphid Dose SWA cause itching on the body? No. The neonate that crawl over the body of the person may give a tickling sensation but not known to cause any allergic irritation. SWA is spreading to the entire field within 10 days. Not true. If the climate is favourable, it would take a minimum of two to three months to spread to entire field. Is Thimet granule application very effective for SWA? No. It will give only 50 per cent control which is not sufficient to minimize SWA population. Since Thimet granules have powerful odour, SWA is effectively controlled even when they are placed in perforated polythene bags and the bags are hung at different places in the cane field. Not true. The respiratory system of human and that of insect is entirely different. Unless the chemical has specific fumigant action and when it could be used in air tight places then only the fumigant action will work. Since, Thimet is not a fumigant it cannot be effective against SWA when suspended on sugarcane plants and even if it is a fumigant it cannot work in the open. Is methyl parathion dust very effective for SWA? Not so. Dusts in general are less effective than EC formulations because it cannot be applied thoroughly to cover the lower surface of leaves and are not systemic. Is there any microbial agent for SWA control? No. There are no microbial agents native to SWA. The pathogens of other insects are not effective also. Moreover spraying the pathogen in sugarcane field is very difficult as they have to be sprayed only on the under surface of the leaves to facilitate contact with the pest. Where we can get predators of SWA? They will be available in the SWA infested field itself and not commercially available anywhere. However a method to rear it in trays by farmers themselves has been developed by SBI. Can SWA attack any other crop? Though there reports that it develops in maize and sorghum it is not recorded widely. Moreover, because of the long duration and continuous availability of sugarcane crop and the ability of SWA to attack any stage of sugarcane crop, there is no pressure on the aphid to switch or seek other hosts as alternatives. How to control the wooly aphid pest infestation in sugarcane? Application of granular systemic insecticides after two days of irrigation may reduce the infestation of aphids even up to 30 days. During acute incidence, spray any one of the following insecticides once or twice in affected patches: Acephate 75SP 2gm/lit (or) Chlorpyrifos 25EC 2ml/lit (or) Monocrotophos 36WSC 2ml/lit. What are the biological control methods for wooly aphids in sugarcane? Conservation of lepidopteran predator, Dipha aphidivora predator population in limited areas of sugarcane crop for further distribution and use thereof. Regular surveillance and monitoring of sugarcane woolly aphid for timely forewarning and adoption of IPM measures including judicious use of recommended pesticides and bio-pesticides (Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana, Verticillium lecanii). Pyrilla How do the Leaf hopper/canefly look like? Major pest distributed throughout India. The adults are straw-coloured, with posterior-portion of the wings darker, wings folded on back in a roof-like manner and head projected forward forming a rostrum. Eggs are laid in clusters of 20-25, on the under surface of leaves, and are covered by a white-fluffly material. Nymphs are pale brown with a pair of wax - covered anal processes. When can expect the incidence of Pyrilla pest in sugarcane? This pest normally infests the crop during pre-monsoon period, mostly from August to October months in the coastal region of Tamil Nadu. How should pyrilla be controlled? In peninsular India, pyrilla had never assumed a pest status. The nymphal instars have five stages and the skin moulted at each stage sticks to the leaves persistently giving an illusion of severe pyrilla population. Moreover, in all parts of peninsular India its parasitoid Epiricania melanoleuca is present which will (automatically) naturally control the pest. It is very important not to spray any insecticide in pyrilla affected field where Epiricania is present. How do the Leaf hopper/canefly Quality of juice effected? Nymphs and adults suck sap from the leaves. In severe cases the leaves fade and dry up. Plants present a sickly and blighted appearance. Insects excrete honeydew on which sooty mould develops. Since, sucrose content is reduced; the quality of Jaggery is drastically affected. White Fly What are the symptoms caused by white fly attack in sugarcane? The insects appear as immobile white and black spots/dots on leaves, the black one being nymphal instars and white the puparia. The insects adhere to the undersurface of leaves and desap the plant. The affected crop turns pale, yellow, reddish brown in later stage and finally the leaves dry up. Yield loss of cane and sugar is considerable in damaged fields. How to manage the white fly damage?  Spray any one of the following when the incidence is noticed (1000 l spray fluid): Fenitrothion 50 EC 2000 ml (or) Monocrotophos 36 WSC 2000 ml.  Spraying acephate 2g per lit water will control whitefly. The spray has to be repeated after a month to kill the nymphs emerging from eggs.  Being a sucking pest, this pest becomes more predominant in problem soil areas as encountered in saline, alkaline, poor drainage, micronutrient deficiency, drought conditions etc. Ill drained fields are more affected. White Grub How to control the white grub incidence in sugarcane? Avoid ratoons in infested fields, Provide adequate irrigation, since under inadequate soil moisture conditions, the pest appear in the root zone. Apply lindane 1.3 D 125 kg/ha near the root zone and give one more round 30 days later How to control white grubs in standing sugarcane crop? It is very difficult and a costly operation to control white grubs in standing crop of sugarcane. No insecticide is effective against white grubs. Stagnating water for 24hrs in the cane crop will bring the grubs above ground which may be handpicked and destroyed. Care to prevent lodging of crop due water stagnation should be taken. Rat How to control rat? First it has to be ascertained whether the rats come from outside the sugarcane field or live inside the sugarcane fields. Generally, if they are coming from outside the cane fields, the attack will start from the boundaries. If they have burrows inside the field, the attack will be in patches at the beginning itself. After the cane harvest, the live burrows in and around the sugarcane fields are to be identified. This is done by first plugging the rat holes with mud and inspecting them the next day to check whether they are opened. The opened burrows indicate rat activity. These burrows should be applied with half half a tablet of celphos and the burrow mouth plugged with the mud. Since celphos is a fumigant with odour less poisonous gas it should be handled only by the experienced persons and two persons should handle it. The soft rind varieties such as Co 86032 may be avoided in rat attack prone areas and hard rind varieties may be grown. Which is the best chemical for poison baiting of rats? In general poison baits will not be of much use in fields that have abundant food supply. If zinc phosphide is used in baits, the rats will develop bait shyness after a few feeding and baiting will become ineffective. Moreover, the baits will kill birds such as peacock, patridge, quoel etc. Any predators are available for use against rats? Available but not practicable. Wild cats, snakes, owls, mongoose, jackals etc are effective but cannot be brought to cane fields. Domestic cats besides being not so effective will become used to the feeds provided by human beings or would hunt easier prey such as lizard and may not effectively hunt rats. Can we use cats, snakes, owls for rat control? They are natural predators of rat. However, to colonies them in sugarcane fields is difficult process. Even if they are colonized the danger of snake bite and the hooting of owl is considered inauspicious. Except jungle cats, domestic ones may not be effective hunters of rat in the field and may pose danger to domestic birds. Besides, the predators in general have strong territorial behavior and so it is not possible to have any number of predators than destined ones in a unit area. Because of this the desired result will not be achieved in the expected time frame. Moreover, once the rat problem is solved these predators may be danger or nuisance to us. Should an extra sticking agent added with insecticide solution for better sticking on foliage? No. The insecticide itself contains the sticking agent. For instance, if you take Chlorpyriphos 20EC, of the one litre of insecticide purchased, only 200ml (20%) is the actual insecticide and the remaining 80% are the wetting, sticking, spreading, and emulsifying agents to make the insecticide effective. So is the malathion 50EC or Nuvan 76EC etc. In which soil nematode infection is predominant? Loamy soils have more nematode problem rather than in the wet clayey soils. How to control the incidence of sugarcane nematodes?  Apply carbofuran 3G @ 33 kg/ha at the time of planting or 2 months after planting or Cartap 1.5 kg a.i./ha or apply pressmud at 15 t/ha or poultry manure @ 2 t/ha or neem cake 2 t/ha or apply pressmud @ 15 t/ha or poultry manure @ 1 t/ha before last ploughing in garden lands.  Under wetland conditions, intercropping sunnhemp or marigold or daincha coupled with application of pressmud 25 t/ha or neem cake 2 t/ha. Diseases Red Rot How the red rot disease spreads in sugarcane? The disease is mainly spread by the preparation of setts from diseased cane. Bottom portion of the cane left over in the field after harvest, irrigation, rain and wind also spread the disease causing fungi. Ratooning of the affected cane also spread the disease further. What is the sett treatment to control the red rot disease? Adopt sett treatment with Carbendazim before planting (Carbendazim 50 WP (0.5 gm in 1 litre of water) or Carbendazim 25 DS (1gm in 1 litre of water) along with Urea (10 gm in 1 litre of water) for 5 minutes) to avoid the red rot disease in sugarcane. At what stage of the crop the disease is expected? The disease occurs in all the stages of crop in the field from germination to harvest. What are the typical symptoms? Orange / yellow discolouration of leaves followed by drying of canes in a clump. External rind discolouration as dull brown patches on nodes and internodes. Splitting of the canes reveal the typical reddening of internodal tissues with intermittent white spots. At later stage mycelia growth is seen in pith region. What type of symptoms can be seen on leaves? Usually leaves in the infected canes show orange to yellow discolouration before drying. In highly susceptible varieties reddish brown lesions on the mid ribs can be seen. How it affects the crop yield? Infected stalks result in death of canes, leading to reduced cane yield. Inversion of sucrose into glucose and fructose due to pathogenic invertases cause loss in sugar recovery. How to identify disease infection in seed canes? While cutting partially infected canes cut ends will show reddening and nodal region may show rectotic patches. Will it cause more damages in ratoon? Yes. Since the initial inoculum to cause the disease is high, more damage to the crop is noticed in ratoon crop than in plant crop. However, in case of epidemic situations plant crop also suffers more damage. Do the pathogens survive in the soil? Yes. It survives for a limited period in the soil, but in the leftover infected stubbles it survives for many months. In which season the disease spread fast? During monsoon seasons the spread is more Factors enhancing disease severity? Monsoon months with cyclonic winds favour spread of the disease very fast. Flooding of sugarcane fields over large areas favour dispersal of inoculums through flood water. Even a limited seed cane infection favours disease built up in plant and ratoon crops. What are the varieties available for cultivation? Co 86032, Co 86249, Co 93009, Co 97008, Co 99004, Co 99006 Is it advisable to plant sugarcane in redroot affected fields? No. Once red rot infection is noticed, planting of susceptible sugarcane varieties should not be done. If resistant varieties are available planting can be taken up. What is to be done after noticing the first symptoms? The infected clumps should be uprooted and burnt immediately to prevent spread of inoculums. Uprooted areas should be drenched with 0.05% Carbendazim to arrest the inoculums spread. Effectiveness of fungicide control? Spraying of fungicide is not effective since the pathogens are deep seated in the cane. Dipping of setts in systemic fungicide before planting will help to prevent soil-borne infection in causing disease in the germination phase. Can we cultivate red rot susceptible varieties with proper plant protection methods? Yes. It can be cultivated in red rot free areas. By practicing integrated approaches of clean seed, field hygiene, disease surveillance and water management it can be controlled effectively. However it is suggested to avoid susceptible varieties in epidemic situations.158. What cares can to be taken in seed nurseries : The nursery crop should be raised in red rot free area. In any case red rot infected fields should not considered for seed purpose. The seed crop should be monitored regularly to ascertain its freedom from the disease. Smut What is sugarcane smut? Sugarcane smut is a serious disease of sugarcane which can reduce yields by 30 to 100 percent. The disease is caused by the fungus Ustilago scitaminea. It is highly infectious and can be spread by wind or carried on clothing and machinery. What are the diagnostic symptoms in the field? Conversion of growing apex region into a blackish whip-like structure containing millions of black powdery spores covered by translucent white silvery membrane. When the symptoms will be manifested? The symptoms can be seen at all the stages. More symptoms can be seen during cane formation. In ratoons symptoms can be seen much earlier. In severe cases sprouts from the ratoon would show whips. Why the smut affected canes show whips? Smut fungus infects the cane systematically including apical meristem. After infecting apical meristem, the fungus converts the growing shoot into a whip-like structure with millions of smut spores covered with silvery membrane. How the disease spreads? Primary transmission takes place through infected seed canes. In the field through air the spores from the whips are transmitted from cane to cane in the field. Why do the affected canes turn bushy? Since the pathogens infection in the meristem breaks the apical dominance numerous side shoots are induced in the smut infected plant, which gives the bushy appearance. At what situations smut causes severe yield losses? When severe smut infection occurs during early stage of the crop of the ratoon significantly yield reduction is expected. Is it amenable for heat therapy? Yes. Hot water combined with fungicide (Tridimefon 0.1%) at 52?C; 30 min effective in eliminating pathogen infection in the setts. Can the affected crop be rationed? Crop showing more than 2% of smut infection should not be ratooned. Up to what level of disease seed selection can be permitted? Up to 1% smut infection level the seed selection can be permitted. What other diseases may look like smut?  Pokkah boeng  Top rot  Sooty mould Herbicide damage may also look similar. Wilt What are the diagnosable symptoms? External  gradual yellowing and drying of foliage, shrinkage and withering of canes. Internal  infected canes show light to dark reddish brown discolouration of ground tissue, pithiness and boat shaped cavities in the middle of the internode. How to differentiate the stalk symptoms with red rot? Reddening of ground tissue with characteristics white spots as red rot are absent in case of wilt. Further wilt affected cane would show pithiness with boat shaped cavities with reddish brown discolouration. Whether sugarcane is infected by both red rot and wilt same time? Yes. Such canes show symptoms of both the diseases. What aggravates wilt severity? Extended drought in the summer followed by water logging in the monsoon. Damages to roots, especially by root borer and other root pests increase wilt severity. How to control wilt? Healthy seed, crop rotation, optimizing soil moisture status and reducing root borer infestation are recommended to control wilt in an integrated approach. Sett Rot Why the germination phase vulnerable to infection? Surviving pathogen in the soil enters the sett tissues through cut ends and cause rotting if they are not protected with fungicide, delay in germination due to deep planting or water stagnation in the field enhance entry into the setts and pathogenesis. Is it amenable for fungicide control? Yes. Dipping of setts in the fungicide solution (Carbendazim, 0.05%) protests the cut ends from the surviving fungus in the soil. How to prevent this disease? Avoiding deep planting during monsoon and preventing water stagnation during germination phase. Dipping of setts in fungicide has to be done as a prophylactic measure before planting. What are varieties that are susceptibile to top rot in sugarcane? Some of the susceptible varieties are CoC 671, CoC 90063 and CoC 92061. Grassy Shoot What are the varieties that are resistant to sugarcane grassy shoot disease? Grassy shoot disease resistant varieties of sugarcane include Co 86249, CoG 93076 and CoC 22. What are the possible treatments for grassy shoot of sugarcane?  Treat setts with aerated steam at 50°C for 1 hour to control primary infection.  Spray dimethoate @ 1ml in 1 litre of water to control insect vector  Avoid ratooning if GSD incidence is more than 15 % in the plant crop What is responsible for the disease? Phytoplasmas. What are the characteristic symptoms? Profuse tillering with lean, lanky and chlorotic tillers. Stunting of affected canes with auxiliary bud sprouting. How to differentiate its symptoms with deficiency symptoms. Excess tillering with chlorotic leaves (partial or complete) is the typical symptoms the excess tillering will not be seen. Further the axillary buds show sprouting only in GSD affected canes. Chlorosis due to iron show recovery of symptoms when sprayed with ferrous sulphate whereas in case of no recovery will be there. Further, GSD appears in isolated clumps whereas chlorosis due to deficiency appears in patches. Why it is more severe in ratoons? Due to low pathogen load in plant crop, the crop suffers less. Once ratooned, the pathogen in ht stubbles initiates disease in the newly emerging shoots and such clumps will not millable canes. How the pathogen spreads? Infected seed cane serves as primary source and insect vectors spread the pathogen cane to cane in the field. Is it amenable for heat therapy? Yes. Aerated steam therapy eliminates the pathogen in the seed canes. Yellow Leaf Disease What are the characteristic symptoms? Yellowing of mid ribs in the 3 to 5 leaves during and after cane formation stages. Laminar yellowing along the discoloured mid rib and drying of leaf along the mid rib from the tip. Will it affect the crop yield? If so to what extent? The disease affects the yield significantly in susceptible varieties as well as in uncared fields. Expression of the disease in the early sage would cause more damage to the crop. In the affected canes intermodal elongation gradually decrease and show bunching of leaves in the apex. In addition to loss in cane yield, sugar recovery is also affected in the infected canes. How the disease spreads? Through infected seed canes and insect vectors. How to control the disease? Through meristem tip culture, the virus can be eliminates from the cane. Later proper seed nursery programmes are to be followed to ensure supply of disease free seed canes. Ratoon Stunting Does it affect ratoon crop only? No. It also affects plant crop. But the severity is more in ratoons. How the disease can be recognized in the field? Slow decline of varietal performance with cane thinness and poor vigour. Is there any diagnosable symptoms?? Reddening of nodal tissue (internal) in the form of streaks, dots or commas. No symptoms can be seen in internodes. Why the canes become thin due to RSD? The pathogenic bacterium systemically colonizes the xylem vessels. If the same seed source is used for many years the pathogen titre increase and cause decline in varietal performance. What are the suggested control measures? Aerated steam therapy eliminates the pathogen from the infected canes. Use of disinfectants to clean seed cane cutting tools would reduce chances of spread of pathogen from infected to healthy setts. Top of page Sugarcane Processing What should be the criteria for the best quality of cane / juice?  Should have accumulated peak sucrose content in juice  Should have low level of non sugars  Should have high purity  Should have optimum fibre content  Should have negligible amount of unwanted materials (trash, binding materials, dead and dry canes, mud particles, water shoots, etc.)  Should have higher quantity of juice  There should not be pith in the can What are the factors that affect the quality of the juice? Factors like variety, nutrient management practices, stage of maturity, soil condition, growing condition, lime and method of harvesting, and time of transport to mill, incidence of pest and disease etc. have profound influence on the accumulation of sucrose and other non-sugars in cane juice. How does the soil type and quality of irrigation water affect the quality of sugarcane? The quantity and quality of irrigation water also influences the juice quality to a large extent. Cane grown under saline and alkaline conditions tends to accumulate large proportion of chlorides and sodium in addition to increased mineral content. Sugarcane grown under river water irrigation produces juice of better quality as compared to sugarcane grown under well water. Reduction in sheath moisture by increasing interval of irrigation at maturity phase is reported to be conducive for increased sucrose content in juice. What is the composition of cane juice? The constituents of the normal cane juice fall within the following limits: Water: 75 to 88% Sucrose : 10 to 21% Reducing sugars: 0.3 to 3% Organic matter other than sugar: 0.5 to 1% Inorganic compounds: 0.2 to 0.6% Nitrogenous bodies: 0.5 to 1% What is meant by maturity / ripening in sugarcane? In sugarcane by maturity or ripeness it is generally meant the stage which the juices in the cane stalk contains an economic level of sucrose and not to the changeover of the crop from vegetative to reproductive phase. At this stage, the stalk will contain stored sugar to support reproduction, but its sugar storage potential has not necessarily been realized. In a simple way ripening is storage of excess sucrose. If juice pol and purity percentages are more than 16 and 85, respectively the cane is considered to be ripe. Several factors like soil fertility, added fertilizers (quantity and time), pests and disease attack in addition to variety and weather parameters actually decide the maturity of the cane. How to determine the maturity / ripeness of sugarcane? Small mill test: the juice is analysed for brix, sucrose and purity values in laboratory using brix hydrometer spindle and polarimeter. A minimum purity value of above 85% indicates its suitability for harvest. Ratio of top / bottom brix: as the stalk gradually ripens, the brix of the joints up to the one leaving the highest dead leaf tends to become equal. Hence when a stalk is divide into equal parts, the ratio of their average brix, the so called top / bottom ratio (TBR) will be indicative of the degree of ripeness. In the case of unripe cane this ratio will be less than one. As the cane ripens TBR will approach unity. How to conduct a pre-harvest maturity survey in sugar factory?  The maturity survey should be started at least 4-6 weeks before the scheduled harvest date.  Separate survey for plant crop and ratoon crop should be preferable.  The fields should be grouped according to variety and month of planting.  Entire area in a factory zone should be grouped into number of zones of convenient size of about 50-60 ha.  For each zone or area one team of persons comprising one Cane Assistant with two laborers for collection of samples should be assigned.  Each team can normally visit 20-25 fields per day and complete the work. Thus one team can complete the survey in approximate 120-150 fields within 6 days.  About 40 teams for each factory area can complete the entire area of a factory (5000-7000 ha) during one week time.  The refractometer brix values of representative samples of each field should be recorded with the help of a hand refractometer and juice extractor needles.  Then the fields are arranged in the descending order of brix values for each zone.  Cutting orders are issued based on the brix values in descending order. The above method of issuing cutting order helps to crush the cane of uniform maturity and avoids cane of immaturity, thus leading to improvement in sugar recovery to the tune 0.2 to 0.5 per cent over and above the existing sugar recovery figure. How long a harvested cane can be kept without deterioration? A well ripened harvested crop, may lose its sugar within a few days after harvest, which tends to increase further due to high ambient temperature, pre-harvest burning, harvest and transportation injuries and microbial infestation. However, not much harm is caused if the cane is crushed within 24 hours of harvesting. Stalling beyond 24 hours results in considerable loss in cane weight due to moisture loss and reduction in juice sucrose content due to inversion. Such juice also creates problems in processing. The losses increased with the increase in duration of stalling. What are the varieties tolerant to post harvest deterioration? Varieties CoC 671, Co 7314 and Co 775 were found to be comparatively resistant than CoJ 64, CoS 510, Co 7240, CoC 8001, Co 6907 and Co 62175. Studies at Coimbatore indicated that CoC 671 is comparatively less prone to post harvest inversion than Co 6304. CoC 671 stales less and is less inclined to inversion or dextran formation, even after 14-16 months. How to minimize post harvest deterioration in sugarcane? 1. Harvesting of immature and over mature canes should be avoided. 2. Quick transport of varieties identified to be susceptible to post-harvest deterioration. 3. Keeping the harvested cane under shade during hot weather period 4. Covering of harvested cane with trash and sprinkling of water periodically to keep the cane moist. 5. By dipping the cut ends of cane in certain biocides like polycide @ 2 ml/lit or bactrinol-100 @ 100 ppm and spraying the same on the stored cane could arrest deterioration upto 120 hours. 6. Dipping both the cut ends of cane in sucroguard improved sugar recovery upto 0.9%. Due to 70% reduction in microbial population of the primary juice of cane. What is the composition of cane jaggery? The jaggery contains approximately 60-85% sucrose, 5-15% glucose and fructose. Along with 0.4% of protein, 0.1 g of fat and 0.6 to 1.0 g of minerals (8 mg of calcium, 4 mg of phosphours and 11.4 mg of iron). It is also found to contain traces of vitamins and amino acids. 100g of jiggery gives 383 kcal of energy. In ayurvedha, jaggrery is considered as the best base material for the preparation of medicines. In contrast, the white crystal sugar contains only sucrose to the tune of 99.5% without any minerals. What is an ideal juice clarificant for jaggery making? The clarificant should meet the following requirements  Removal of all constituents of juice other than sucrose, reducing sugars, inorganics (phosphates, iron and calcium) and organics (higher proteins and fats)  Control of undesirable colour development and inversion of sucrose during boiling and concentration.  Better crystallization.  Prevention of overheating and charring.  No adverse effect on jaggery taste and human health.  Longer storage life of the product.  Easy availability of clarifying agent. What are the various vegetable clarificants that are used for jaggery making? Stem and root of green plant of Deola and Bhendi, Green bark of the Phasla and Semul trees, dry bark of the sukhlai plant, Seeds of castor, groundnut and soyabean. The quantity of clarificant is approximately 40-70 g per 100 lit of cane juice. What are the various chemical clarificants that are used for jaggery making? Hydros (sodium hydrogen sulphite), Lime (calcium oxide), Sodium bicarbonate, Sodium carbonate, Sajji (50% sodium carbonate, 6.4% sodium sulphate, 4.5% sodium chloride), Super phosphate and alum are used. Use of various chemicals as juice clarificants during jaggrey preparation results in presence of harmful chemicals like SO2 in jiggery and also affects the taste and storability of such jaggery. What are the varieties good for jaggery making? State Varieties Andhra Pradesh : Co 6907, CoT 8201, Co 8013, Co 62175, Co 7219, Co 8014, CoR 8001 Bihar : CoS 767, Bo 91, Co 1148 Gujarat : CoC 671, Co 7527, Co 62175, Co 8041, Co 740 Haryana : Co 7717, Co 1148, Co 1158, CoS 767 Karnataka : Co 7704, Co 62175, Co 8014, Co 8011, CoC 671, Co 86032 Madhya Pradesh : Co 775, Co 7314, Co 6304, Co 62175 Maharashtra : Co 775, Co 7219, CoC 671,Co740,Co 7257,C0 86032 Orissa : Co 7704,Co 7219,Co 62175,Co 6304 Punjab : CoJ 64,Co 1148,CoJ 81 Rajasthan : Co 997,Co 419 Tamil Nadu : CoC 671, Co 62175, Co7704, Co 6304, Co 8021, Co 86032,CoC 92061 Uttar Pradesh : CoS 687, CoJ 64, Co1148, CoS 767, CoS 767, CoS 802,CoS 7918, Co 1158, CoS 8408, CoS 8432, Bo 91, CoS 8315, CoS 8016,CoS 8118, CoS 8119, Bo 19, CoS 837 West Bengal : CoJ 64, Co 1148 What are the methods of jaggery storage? The following methods may be adopted for the storage of jiggery without much deterioration in quality.  Large quantities of jaggery may be stored in the go-downs provided with moisture absorbing agents like calcium chloride or quick lime.  Use sugarcane trash, fly ash, palmirah leaves, paddy husk etc, in between layers of jaggery.  Smoking of go-down with paddy husk particularly during monsoon period.  Storing of jaggery under low temperature maintains freshness in flavour and no loss in sucrose content.  Storing of jaggery in gunny lined with black polythene sheets.  Drying of gur in shade during summer to a moisture content of less than 6% and storage of dried gur in polythene lined gunny bags improves shelf life of jaggery.  Ordinary earthen pots painteeed from inside as well as outside, wooden boxes, baskets made of palmirah leaves can be used for storing jaggery at home. What are the standard specifications for cane jaggery grading? S.No. Characterstics Grade 1 Grade 2 1. Sucrose % (minimum) 80 70 2. Reducing sugars % (maximum) 10 20 3. Moisture % (maximum) 5 7 4. Water insoluble matter % (maximum) 1.5 2.0 5. Sulphated ash % (maximum) 3.5 5.0 6. Sulphur dioxide ppm (maximum) 50 50 7. Ash insoluble in dilute HCL (maximum) 0.3 0.3 How to make organic jaggery? Many times the market jaggery has been found to contain excess quantities of harmful chemicals like sulphur dioxide. Due to use of chemicals the taste and storability of such jaggery is also affected. In this context growing of sugarcane naturally and with use of organics and also preparation of jaggery with use of organic clarificants assumes importance in order to produce quality jaggery. There is a growing demand for organically produced jaggery both within the country and in the export market. For preparation of organic jaggery, the sugarcane should be grown in field free from any residue of chemical fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides etc. from the previous crop. Follow all the recommended techniques for growing the sugarcane by applying only organic source of required nutrients, totally avoiding pesticides and herbicides. For controlling the pest, biocontrol methods may be adopted. How to prepare liquid jaggery? Liquid jaggery is an intermediate product obtained during jaggery making. This contains water, sugars and non-sugars. Fructose and glucose are in equal proportions with proteins, organic acids, and minerals. After the juice is extracted, potassium alum crystals added to the juice. This facilitates sedimentation of solid particles. The clear juice is poured into a boiling pan. About 50 g of lime is added to bring the ph to 6.0. Bhendi mucilage is added and the first scum is removed when the temperature is 85°C. Chemical clarificants include phosphoric acid and super phosphate. Boiling is continued and the second scum is removed at 98°C. The strike point is 106°C and at this stage the pan is removed and 0.04% of citric acid is added. Liquid jaggery is sweeter than cane sugar and jaggery. After complete settling, liquid jaggery is filled in clean and sterilized bottles. This can be stored for 1-1½ years. It is necessary to add 0.1% sodium metebisulphite for better preservation. How to prepare bottled sugarcane juice? 1. Choose a variety with high sugar content, light coloured and with less fiber (CoC 671, Co 62175, Co 7717, Co 86032, Co 86249 and Co 94012). 2. Grow the cane in normal soils with good quality water. 3. Use organic manure liberally instead of inorganic fertilizers. 4. Avoid high and late application of nitrogen. 5. Choose the pest and disease free cane for crushing. 6. Harvest the cane at peak maturity. 7. Crush the cane within 24 hours after removal of rind. 8. Add one lemon with 2 to 3 g of ginger for every 3 kg of cane material. 9. Warm the juice to 60 to 70°C and keep it at that temperature for 15 minutes. 10. Remove the impurities by filtering the juice with a muslin cloth. 11. To the clear juice add sodium metasulphite as a preservative at a rate of 1 g per 8 lit of juice. 12. Transfer to a hot water sterilized bottles, close it with a corking machine. 13. Serve chilled. 14. Bottled juice can be stored for 6 to 8 weeks. 15. Initial investment required for bottling 500 Nos. per day will be approx. 16. Rs. 10,000/- (cost of bottles, stainless steel vessels, electric heaters, hot water sterilization tank and corking machine excluding cost of crusher). Top of page Ratoon Management Is there any technology for improving sprouting in winter initiated ratoon? To improve sprouting in winter initiated ratoon potash at the rate of 80 kg/ha along with irrigation, one month prior to plant cane harvest is given. FYM based Trichoderma culture @ 20 kg/ha with PMC (10 t/ha) application helps in sprouting of winter initiated ratoon. Which method is suitable for obtaining optimum number of millable cane from ratoon crop? Farmers can obtain higher ratoon yield when sugarcane is planted under paired row system (30: 120 cm) with 20% higher on normal seed rate and gap filling at 1st irrigation in ratoon crop. This also curtails the gap filling operation in ratoon crop. Please tell the suitable gap filling material and when gap should be filled in ratoon crop? 30-35 days old polythene bag/STP raised settlings are suitable gap filling material. The gap appearing at above 60 cm should be filled within 30 days after ratoon initiation. What is method of trash mulching and their advantages in ratoon crop. Trashes collected after harvest of plant crop should be evenly spread in alternate rows,followed by light irrigation and spray of Chlorpyriphos 20 EC solution @ 5.0 liters/ha in 1600 liters of water to control termite and army-worm. Trash mulching in ratoon conserves moisture and thus, preserves ground water by saving irrigation water up to 30- 40%. It also improves soil fertility and helps in weed check.
