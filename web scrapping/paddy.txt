Botany of Paddy HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Botany Climate Statistics Area, Production and yield of paddy in the world 2008 - 09 Area, Production and yield of paddy in the major states of India 2009 - 10 Area, Production and yield of paddy in Tamil Nadu 2008 - 09 Area, Production and yield of paddy in Kerala 2005 - 06 Area, Production and yield of paddy in Karnataka 2006 - 07 Area, Production and yield of paddy in India based on Rice Ecosystem Botany of Paddy Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world and it is the staple food for over 2.7 billion people. In India, area under rice is 44.6 m ha with total output of 80 million tonnes (paddy) with an average productivity of 1855 kg/ha. It is grown in almost all the states. West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Tamilnadu, Kerala, Punjab, Maharashtra and Karnataka are major rice growing states and contribute to total 92% of area and production. Kingdom: Plantae Division: Magnoliophyta Class: Liliopsida Order: Cyperales Family: Gramineae Genus: Oryza Species: Sativa Subspecies: Indica Common name: Paddy in English, Nel in Tamil, Nellu in Malayalam, Bhatta in Kannada. Top Root Rice form a fibrous root system consisting of seminal, nodal and lateral roots. As the rice grain germinates, the radical pierces its way out through the coleorhizae and the enveloping glume and forms the seminal root. Lateral roots are formed from the seminal root. As the seedlings begin to grow, adventitious roots arise from the basal nodes. When seedlings are pulled out, most of the roots get torn off but very soon fresh roots develop. The root system in rice varies much between the different varieties. Root development is promoted by organic manures and phosphatic manures. Clayey soil seems to be ideal for the normal development of the roots. Nodal roots develop on the higher nodes and help the plant to absorb the food material from the surrounding water. Top Culm or Stem The culm, or jointed stem of the rice, is made up of a series of nodes and internodes The stem of rice popularly known as the haulm or the culm, is generally erect, cylindrical, hollow at the internodes and solid at the nodes. The number and length of internodes vary with the different varieties. There may be ten to twenty internodes. In deep water rice varieties and in floating types, the culms have generally very long internodes. Top Tillers The node is the solid portion of the culm. The node or nodal region bears a leaf and a bud. The bud is attached to the upper portion of the node and is enclosed by the leaf sheath. The bud may give rise to a leaf or a tiller. Early tillers arise from the main culm in an alternate pattern. Primary tillers originate from the lowermost nodes and give rise to secondary tillers. Secondary tillers produce tertiary tillers. Each tiller is an independent plant. The maximum production of tillers is generally attained thirty to forty days after transplanting. Top Leaf The node or nodal region of the culm will bear a leaf. Leaves are borne alternately on the culm in opposite directions. One leaf is produced at each node. Varieties differ in the number of leaves produced. The topmost leaf below the panicle is the flag leaf. The flag leaf contributes largely to the filling of grains because it supplies photosynthetic products, mainly to the panicle The leaf sheath and leaf blade are continuous. A circular collar joins the leaf blade and the leaf sheath. The leaf sheath is wrapped around the culm above the node. The swelling at the base of the leaf sheath,just above the node,is the sheath pulvinus. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the node. Leaf blades are generally flat. Varieties differ in blade length, width, thickness, area, shape, color, angle and pubescence. With many parallel veins on the upper surface of the leaf, the underside of the leaf blade is smooth with a prominent ridge in the middle; the midrib Most leaves possess small, paired ear-like appendages on either side of the base of the blade - called auricles. Auricles may not be present on older leaves. Another leaf appendage is the ligule, a papery membrane at the inside juncture between the leaf sheath and the blade It can have either a smooth or hair-like surface. The length, color, and shape of the ligule differ according to variety. Top Panicle The terminal component of the rice tiller is an inflorescence called as panicle. The inflorescence or panicle is borne on the uppermost internode of the culm. The panicle bears rice spikelets, which develop into grains. The panicle base often appears as a hair like ring and is used as a dividing point in measuring culm and panicle length. The panicle base is often called the neck. The panicle axis is continuous and hollow except at the nodes where branches are borne. The swellings at the panicle axis where the branches are borne are referred to as the panicle pulvinus. Each node on the main panicle axis gives rise to primary branches which in turn bears secondary branches. Primary branches may be arranged singly or in pairs. The panicles bear spikelets, most of which develop into grains. These spikelets are borne on the primary and secondary branches. The spikelet is the basic unit of the inflorescence and panicle. It consists of the pedicel and the floret . The floret is borne on the pedicel. The rudimentary glumes are the laterally enlarged, cup like apex of the pedicel. The rudimentary glumes are the lowermost parts of the spikelet. During threshing, the rudimentary glumes are separated from the rest of the spikelet. The sterile lemmas are small, bractlike projections attached to the floret. The rachillae is a small axis that bears the single floret. It is between the sterile lemmas and the floret Top Spikelets The spikelets are carried on small rachillae at the ends of the branches of the panicle. The spikelet in rice is single flowered enclosed by the lemma and palea. There are six stamens, in two whorls of three each, the filaments being very slender and delicate and having sudden exertion of growth at the time of anthesis. The anthere are linear. The pistil has a single ovary, two styles each with a plumose and laterally exerted stigma ovary, two styles each with a plumose and laterally exerted stigma of different shades of purple. The overy is tricarpellary, single celled, single ovuled and with basal placentation. In most cases the plumose stigmas are dusted with pollen when they emerge out as the dehiscence of the anthers takes place in many varieties just at the time of opening. Though self-pollination is the rule, natural cross-pollination also occurs, varying from 0.1 to 4.0 percent. Top Grain The ovule after fertilization develops into the seed with its coats completely fused together with the developing ovary wall or pericarp. Pericarp of fruit coat: The pericarp is made up of distinct layers of quadrangular cells which form the Epicarp. These cells have slight thickening and are followed by cells which are much compressed and form the Mesocarp consisting of two or three layers. The Endocarp is a single layer of tube cells. The color in the rice grain is found in the pericarp layer in the mature stage. The seed coats: Due to the pressure brought out by the developing seed on the pericarp, the testa and tegmen become much pressed down and out of shape. A few layers of such cells below the pericarp can be diagnosed as the integuments of seed coats. The aleurone layer: A prominent layer of rectangular cells which contain protein lies next to the seed coats. This layer is known as the aleurone layer. The layer in rice is not coloured unlike in case of maize. The endosperm: the entire mass of tissue below the aleurone layer is made up of cells which contain plenty of starch grains and these form the endosperm. The embryo: the scutellum has an upper free part which has a fleshy projection known as the ventral scale. Below this upper ventral scale and almost at the middle of the free part there is another outgrowth which can be called as the inner ventral scale and theis inner ventral scale is peculiar to rice embryos only. Top Climate Climate and Soil requirement Rice is a crop of tropical climate. However, it is also grown successfully in humid to sub-humid regions under subtropical and temperate climate. Rice is cultivated in almost all types of soils with varying productivity. Under high temperature, high humidity with sufficient rainfall and irrigation facilities, rice can be grown in any type of soil. The major soil groups where rice is grown are riverine alluvium, red-yellow, red loamy, hill and sub-montane, Terai, laterite, costal alluvium, red sandy, mixed red, black, medium and shallow black soils. Top Latitude and Altitude Rice cultivation in the world extends from 39Â°S latitude (Australia) to 45Â°N latitude (Japan) and 50Â°N latitude (China). Most extensive rice growing areas are within 45Â°N of the equator. In India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice cultivation in India extends from 8 to 35Â°N latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 metres elevation. Top Temperature Rice being a tropical and sub-tropical plant, requires a fairly high temperature, ranging from 20Â° to 40Â°C. The optimum temperature of 30Â°C during day time and 20Â°C during night time seems to be more favorable for the development and growth of rice crop. Top Growth stages and optimum temperature ranges Stage Optimum temperature (Â°C) Germination 20-35 Seedling emergence 25-30 Rooting 25-28 Leaf elongation 31 Tillering 25-31 Panicle initiation 15-30 Anthesis 30-33 Ripening 20-25 Top Sunshine Sunlight is very essential for the development and growth of the plants. The yield of rice is influenced by the solar radiation particularly during the last 35 to 45 days of its ripening period. Bright sunshine with low temperature during ripening period of the crop helps in the development of in the grains. 300 cal /cm-2 /day is minimum required. Better yield is obtained when the Solar Radiation is 500-700 cal /cm-2 /day. Top Rainfall Rainfall has direct impact on deciding the ecosystem. Rice requires abundant rainfall, ranging from 150 cm to 200 cm. Paddy withstands water logged conditions. Grown as low-land crop with standing water as well as upland crop under rainfed conditions. Requires a rainfall of 125 cm during vegetative stage. Heavy downpour at anthesis and flowering leads to sterility No standing water at ripening stage. Top Relative Humidity Relative humidity (RH) directly influences the water relations of plant and indirectly affects leaf growth, photosynthesis, pollination, occurrence of diseases and finally economic yield. The incidence of insect pests and diseases is high under high humidity conditions. High RH favours easy germination of fungal spores on plant leaves. Majority of pest and diseases are commonly seen during rainy season while aphids, thrips, scales, mealy bugs and mites are relatively more severe during summer. Blast disease of rice is common in winter season. The incidence of gall midge is common during kharif as compared to rabi due to high RH requirement of the pest particularly in the early growth stages. Moderate Rainfall, Relative humidity of around 80% and a wide range of atmospheric temperature of 20-33Â°c appear to be highly conducive to the Brown plant hopper. Top Wind Wind is normally unimportant factor in rice production. A light wind is said to be beneficial as it stirs air and transports CO2 to the leaf canopy. Very strong winds do occur during cyclones and lead to severe damage. During pollination, strong wind may induce sterility and increase the number of abortive endosperms. Strong wind during flowering phase may not be conducive for rice crop. High wind speed during flowering may cause pollen dehydration and consequent spikelet sterility.

The asci are cylindrical, piston-shaped, flattened above, and are 90-102 x 7-9 Âµm. They are 4- to 6-spored but seldom 8-spored. Hyphae are branched and septate. The fungus has micro- and macroconidiophores bearing micro- and macroconidia, respectively. The sclerotia are 80 x 100 Âµm. They are dark blue and spherical. The stroma are more or less plectenchymatous and yellowish, brownish, or violet. Gibberella Fujikorai Conidium Micro and Macro Conidia of Bakane Disease Top Management Strategies Clean seeds should be used to minimize the occurrence of the disease. Salt water can be used to separate lightweight, infected seeds from seed lots and thereby reduce seedborne inoculum. Seed treatment using fungicides such as thiram, thiophanate-methyl, or benomyl is effective before planting. Benomyl or benomyl-t at 1-2% of seed weight should be used for dry seed coating. Seed treatment with organo mercurials - Agrosan GN, Ceresan @ 2 g a.i./kg seed is highly effective; steeping seeds in 1% CuSO4 solution or 2% formalin also recommended.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pathogen Management Strategies Blast (Pyricularia oryzae) Symptoms All aboveground parts of the rice plant (leaves, leaf collar, culm, culm nodes, neck, and panicle) are attacked by the fungus initial symptoms are white to gray-green lesions or spots with brown borders Small specks originate on leaves - subsequently enlarge into spindle shaped spots(0.5 to 1.5cm length, 0.3 to 0.5cm width) with ashy center. older lesions elliptical or spindle-shaped and whitish to gray with necrotic borders Several spots coalesce to form big irregular patches. nodal infection causes the culm to break at the infected node Internodal infection also occurs at the base of the plant which causes white panicles similar to that induced by yellow stem borer or water deficit Lesions on the neck are grayish brown and causes the girdling of the neck and the panicle to fall over If infection of the neck occurs before milk stage, no grain is formed, but if infection occurs later, grains of poor quality are formed Lesions on the branches of the panicles and on the spikelet pedicels are brown to dark brown The size and shape of the spots vary on different rice varieties. Lesions on leaves with grey centre and brown margin Spindle shaped lesions on leaves Leaf Blast Severe cases of infection - entire crop give a blasted or burnt appearance- hence the name "BLAST" Severe cases - lodging of crop (after ear emergence) Neck Blast Neck region of panicle develops a black color and shrivels completely / partially grain set inhibited, panicle breaks at the neck and hangs Nodal Blast Nodes become black and break up Neck Blast Nodal Blast Top Identification of pathogen This disease is caused by a fungus named Pyricularia orizae, which overwinters in rice seeds and infected rice stubble. The fungus reproductive structures, spores, can spread from these two sources to rice plants during the next growing season and initiate new infections. Spores from these new infections can spread by wind to other rice plants over great distances. The conidiophores of the pathogen are produced in clusters from each stoma. They are rarely solitary with 2-4 septa. The basal area of the conidiophores is swollen and tapers toward the lighter apex. The conidia of the fungus measure 20-22 x 10-12 Âµm. The conidia are 2-septate, translucent, and slightly darkened. They are obclavate and tapering at the apex. They are truncate or extended into a short tooth at the base. The perfect stage is rarely found in the field. Colony of Pyricularia Oryzae Conidia Conidia are pyriform (pear-like) in shape. pyricularia oryzae microscopic Favourable conditions presence of the blast spores in the air throughout the year upland rice environment and high elevation in the tropics cloudy skies, frequent rain, and drizzles high nitrogen levels like ammonium sulfate high relative humidity (90% and higher) and wet leaves temperature from 25-28Â°C Occurrence Earliest known plant disease Also known as rotten neck or rice fever.

Oryzae) Symptoms Seedling wilt or kresek Observed 1-3 weeks after transplanting Green water-soaked layer along the cut portion or leaf tip of leaves as early symptom Leaves wilt and roll up and become grayish green to yellow Entire plant wilt completely Leaf blight Water-soaked to yellowish stripes on leaf blades or starting at leaf tips with a wavy margin Leaves with undulated yellowish white or golden yellow marginal necrosis, drying of leaves back from tip and curling, leaving mid rib intact are the major symptoms. Appearance of bacterial ooze that looks like a milky or opaque dewdrop on young lesions early in the morning Severely infected leaves tend to dry quickly loss in grain yield may be up to 60%. Confirmation To distinguish kresek symptoms from stem borer damage, the lower end of the infected seedling can be squeezed between the fingers. Yellowish bacterial ooze may be seen coming out of the cut ends. The cut portion can be observed against the light to see the bacterial ooze streaming out from the cut ends into the water. After 1-2 hours, the water becomes turbid. Seedling wilt-Kresek Leaves with wavy yellow marginal necrosis Drying and curling of leaves leaving midrib intact Affected leaves with wavy yellow marginal necrosis Top Identification of pathogen The bacteria causing the disease are rods, 1.2 x 0.3-0.5 Âµm. They are single, occasionally in pairs but not in chains. They are Gram negative, non-spore-forming, and devoid of capsules. Their colonies on nutrient agar are pale yellow, circular, and smooth with an entire margin. They are convex and viscid. Factors favouring disease development presence of weeds presence of rice stubbles and ratoons of infected plants presence of bacteria in the rice paddy and irrigation canals warm temperature(25-30Â° C), , high humidity, rain and deep water. Severe winds, which cause wounds, and over fertilization are suitable factors for the development of the disease. Irrigation water and splashing or windblown rain can disseminate the bacterium from plant to plant. The use of trimming tools for transplanting and by handling during transplanting can also trigger new infection. Bacterial Ooze Microscopic View of Xanthomonas Oryzae Xanthomonas Oryzae Top Management Strategies Preventive method Seed treatment with bleaching powder (100g/l) and zinc sulfate (2%) reduce bacterial blight. Seed treatment - seed soaking for 8 hours in Agrimycin (0.025%) and wettable ceresan (0.05%) followed by hot water treatment for 30 min at 52-54oC; seed soaking for 8 hours in ceresan (0.1%) and treat with Streptocyclin (3g in 1 litre); Spray neem oil 3% or NSKE 5% Spray fresh cowdung extract for the control of bacterial blight.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pathogen Management Strategies Bacterial leaf streak (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzicola) Symptoms Initially, small, dark-green and water-soaked streaks on interveins from tillering to booting stage The progress of the streaks is longitudinal, limited by the veins and soon turn yellow or orange brown. All along the streaks bacterial exudates could be observed as tiny yellow or amber colored droplets. These streaks may coalesce to form large patches and cover the entire leaf surface. Lesions turn brown to greyish white then dry when disease is severe Infection in the florets and seeds results in brown or black discoloration and death of ovary, stamens and endosperm and browning of glumes. Brown to Greyish Longitudinal Streaks on Leaves Lesions turn brown to greyish and drying of leaves Top Identification of pathogen The bacteria causing the disease X. oryzae pv.oryzicola occur as rods. The bacteria have no spores and no capsules. They move with the aid of a single polar flagellum. They are Gram-negative and aerobic and can grow favorably at 28 Â°C. The bacterial colonies on nutrient agar are pale yellow, circular, smooth, convex, and viscid and have an entire margin. Factors favoring disease development Presence of the bacteria on leaves and in the water or those surviving in the debris left after harvest Warm temperature and high humidity Early stage of planting from maximum tillering to panicle initiation Cells of Xanthomonas Oryzae pv Exudate of Xanthomonas Campestris pv. Oryzicola Top Management Strategies The disease can be controlled by proper application of fertilizers and proper plant spacing, use of resistant varieties, and hot water treated seeds. Practicing field sanitation is important. Ratoons, straws and volunteer seedlings left after harvest can be destroyed to minimize the initial inoculum at the beginning of the season. Providing good drainage system especially in seedbeds can also manage this disease. Planting of resistant varieties (IR 20, TKM 6) is the most effective method of controlling bacterial leaf streak. Grow nurseries preferably in isolated upland conditions Avoid clipping of seedlings during transplanting. Spray fresh cowdung water extract or lemon grass or mint extract at 20 %.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pathogen Management Strategies Brown Spot (Helminthosporium oryzae) Symptoms Brown Spot is called as sesame leaf spot or Helminthosporiose or fungal blight The fungus attacks the crop from seedling in nursery to milk stage in main field. The disease appears first as minute brown dots, later becoming cylindrical or oval to circular.(resemble sesame seed) Spots measures 0.5 to 2.0mm in breadth - coalesce to form large patches. Then several spots coalesce and the leaf dries up. Infection also occurs on panicle, neck with brown colour appearance Seeds also infected (black or brown spots on glumes spots are covered by olivaceous velvety growth) The seedlings die and affected nurseries can be often recognized from a distance by their brownish scorched appearance. Dark brown or black spots also appear on glumes. The infection of the seed causes failure of seed germination, seedling mortality and reduces the grain quality and weight. 50% yield reduction in severe cases . Circular or Oval Spots on Leaves Spots on leaves with brown margin Dark Brown or Black Spots on Panicle Glumes and Grains Brown Spot on Grains Mode of spread and survival The infected seeds are the most common source of primary infection. The fungus also survives on collateral hosts. The fungus can survive in the seed for more than 4 years. Infected seeds, volunteer rice, infected rice debris, and several weeds are the major sources of inoculums in the field. Infected seeds give rise to infected seedlings. The fungus can spread from plant to plant and in the field by airborne spores. The disease is common in nutrient-deficient soils and unflooded soil but rare on rice grown on fertile soils. Abnormal soils, which are deficient in nutrient elements, or soils in a much-reduced condition in which toxic substances accumulate favor the development of the disease. Top Identification of pathogen Brown Spot: Helminthosporium oryzaeâFUNGAL DISEASE (Syn: Drechslera oryzae) (Sexual stage : Cochliobolus miyabeanus) The fungi causing the disease occur in two states or stages. These are the asexual stage, which is called anamorph or imperfect stage and the sexual stage, which is called teleomorph or the perfect stage. The somatic structures of the fungus consist of black velvety mycelial mats which are made up of prostrate hyphae and erect sporophores. The hyphae are abundant, branching, and anastomosing. They are dark brown or olivaceous and measure 8-15 Âµm or more in diameter. The sporophores arise as lateral branches from the hyphae. The conidia measure 35-170 x 11-17 Âµm. Typical conidia are slightly curved, widest at the middle and tapering toward the hemispherical apex, where their width approximates half the median width. Mature conidia are brownish with a moderately thin peripheral wall. Favourable conditions Temperature of 25-30Â°C Relative humidity above 80 per cent. Excess of nitrogen aggravates the disease incidence. Leaves must be wet for 8-24 hours for infection to occur. Conidia Fungal Pathogen Fungus Top Management Strategies Cultural methods As disease is seed borne,Use disease free seeds. Removal of alternate & collateral hosts. The use of resistant varieties is the most economical means of control. Growing Resistant varieties like ADT 44,PY 4,CORH 1,CO 44,CAUVERY,BHAVANI,TPS 4 and Dhanu. Providing proper nutrition for optimum plant growth and prevention of water stress seem to be the most important factors in controlling brown spot. The disease is rarely observed in normally fertile rice soils. Soils known to be low in plant-available silicon should be amended with calcium silicate slag before planting and the field should be well irrigated to avoid water stress. Apply Calcium Silicate Slag Use Disease Free Seeds Use Resistant Variety ADT 44 Use Resistant Variety TPS 4 Preventive methods Seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10g/kg of seed followed by seedling dip @ of 2.5 kg or products/ha dissolved in 100 litres and dipping for 30 minutes. seed soak / seed treatment with Captan or Thiram at 2.0g /kg of seed Seed treatment with Agrosan or Ceresan 2.5 g/kg seed to ward off seedling blight stage; Since the fungus is seed transmitted, a hot water seed treatment (53-54Â°C) for 10-12 minutes may be effective before sowing. This treatment controls primary infection at the seedling stage. Presoaking the seed in cold water for 8 hours increases effectivity of the treatment. Fungicide for Seed Treatment- Agrosan pseudomonas Seed Treatment Chemical methods seed soak / seed treatment with Captan or Thiram at 2.0g /kg of seed Spray Mancozeb (2.0g/lit) or Edifenphos (1ml/lit) - 2 to 3 times at 10 - 15 day intervals. Spray preferably during early hours or afternoon at flowering and post - flowering stages. Seed treatment with Agrosan or Ceresan 2.5 g/kg seed to ward off seedling blight stage; Spraying copper fungicides to control secondary spread; Grisepfulvin, nystatin, aureofungin, and similar antibiotics have been found effective in preventing primary seedling infection. Seed treatment with captan, thiram, chitosan, carbendazim, or mancozeb has been found to reduce seedling infection. Seed treatment with tricyclazole followed by spraying of mancozeb + tricyclazole at tillering and late booting stages gave good control of the disease. Application of edifenphos, chitosan, iprodione, or carbendazim in the field is also advisable.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pathogen Management Strategies False Smut (Ustilaginoidea virens) Symptoms Individual rice grain transformed into a mass of yellow fruiting bodies Growth of velvetty spores that enclose floral parts Infected grain has greenish smut balls with a velvetty appearance. The smut ball appears small at first and grows gradually up to the size of 1 cm. It is seen in between the hulls and encloses the floral parts. Only few grains in a panicle are usually infected and the rest are normal. As the fungi growth intensifies, the smut ball bursts and becomes orange then later yellowish-green or greenish-black in color. Infection usually occurs during the reproductive and ripening stages, infecting a few grains in the panicle and leaving the rest healthy. Discolouration of Grains Grains Transformed into a Mass of Yellow Fruiting Bodies Greenish Black Smut Balls with a Velvetty Appearance Smut Balls Bursts and becomes Black in Color Top Identification of pathogen Chlamydospore formed on the spore balls are born laterally on minute sterigmata on radial hyphae, and are spherical to elliptical, warty, olivaceous, 3-5 x 4-6 Âµm. Younger spores are smaller, paler, and almost smooth. Some of the green spore balls develop one to four sclerotia in the center. These sclerotia overwinter in the field and produce stalked stromata the following summer or autumn. In temperate regions, the fungus survives the winter by means of sclerotia as well as chlamydospores. It is believed that the primary infections are initiated mainly by the ascospores produced from the sclerotia. Chlamydospores play an important role in secondary infection, which is a major part of the disease cycle. Conditions that favour disease development presence of rain and high humidity presence of soils with high nitrogen content presence of wind for dissemination of the spores from plant to plant presence of overwintering fungus as sclerotia and chlamydospores flowering stage of the rice crop False Smut Spores Microscopic View of Spores Ustilaginoidea Virens Spores from Infected Rice Grain Top Management Strategies Preventive methods Use of disease-free seeds that are selected from healthy crop. Seed treatment with carbendazim 2.0g/kg of seeds. Control insect pests. Split application of nitrogen is recommended. Removal and proper disposal of infected plant debris. Use Dieases Free Seeds Seed Treatment with Carbendazim Cultural methods Among the cultural control, destruction of straw and stubble from infected plants is recommended to reduce the disease. Use varieties that are found to be resistant or tolerant against the disease in India. Avoid field activities when the plants are wet. Early planted crop has less smut balls than the late planted crop. At the time of harvesting, diseased plants should be removed and destroyed so that sclerotia do not fall in the field.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pathogen Management Strategies Sheath Blight (Rhizoctonia solani) Symptoms The fungus affects the crop from tillering to heading stage. Initial symptoms are noticed on leaf sheaths near water level. On the leaf sheath oval or elliptical or irregular greenish grey spots are formed. As the spots enlarge, the centre becomes greyish white with an irregular blackish brown or purple brown border. Lesions on the upper parts of plants extend rapidly coalesing with each other to cover entire tillers from the water line to the flag leaf. The presence of several large lesions on a leaf sheath usually causes death of the whole leaf, and in severe cases all the leaves of a plant may be blighted in this way. The infection extends to the inner sheaths resulting in death of the entire plant. Older plants are highly susceptible. Five to six week old leaf sheaths are highly susceptible. Plants heavily infected in the early heading and grain filling growth stages produce poorly filled grain, especially in the lower part of the panicle. A yield loss of 25% was reported if the flag leaves are infected. Elliptical or Irregular Greenish Grey Spots on Sheaths Blightening of Sheath near Water Level Blightening of Sheath Discoloration of Sheath Top Identification of pathogen The disease is soilborne The fungus produces usually long cells of septate mycelium which are hyaline when young, yellowish brown when old. It produces large number of globoses sclerotia, which are initially white, later turn to brown or purplish brown. There are three types of mycelium produced: runner hyphae, lobate hyphae, and monilioid cells. Sclerotia consist of compact masses of mycelia. They are irregular, hemispherical, flattened at the bottom, white when young, and turn brown or dark brown when older. Individual sclerotia are 1-6 mm in diameter. They may unite to form a larger mass. Large sclerotia are significantly more virulent than smaller ones. Favourable conditions presence of sclerotia or infection bodies floating on the water presence of the disease in the soil relative humidity from 96 to 100% temperature from 28-32 Â°C high levels of nitrogen fertilizer High seeding rate or closing plant spacing Frequent rain Mode of Spread and Survival The pathogen can survive as sclerotia or mycelium in dry soil for about 20 months but for 5-8 months in moist soil.

The disease is important during the heading towards the maturity stages of the rice crop. Confirmation Lesions develop on the uppermost leaf sheaths that enclose the panicles. Some panicles do not emerge or emerge partially. Rotting of the sheath and the development of whitish powdery fungal growth is usually observed. Irregular Spots on Sheaths Discoloration of Leaf Sheath Panicles remain within the Sheath Rottening of Flag Leaf Sheath Top Identification of pathogen The fungus produces white mycelium, sparsely branched, septate, and measures 1.5-2m in diameter. Conidiophores arising from the mycelium are slightly thicker than the vegetative hyphae, branched once or twice, each time with 3-4 branches in a whorl. The ultimate branches are phialides and produce conidia that are, cylindrical to slightly fusiform, often somewhat curved, hyaline, smooth, single-celled, 4-9 x 1-2.5 m. In some cases, the fungus infects the sheath in combination with bacterial pathogens attacking the sheath and causing grain discoloration (e.g., Pseudomonas fuscovaginae). The fungus invades rice through the plant's stomates and wounds and grows intercellularly in the vascular bundles and mesophyll tissues. The sheath rot fungus survives as a mycelium in infected residue and on seeds. Favourable conditions High amount of nitrogen, high relative humidity, and dense crop growth favors sheath rot development. The fungus grows best at 20 to 28Â°C.

White mycelium and conidia form narrow stripes on the flag leaves along the veins before the panicles emerge. No grains are formed on the affected ear. The diseased plants produce distorted earheads later. Infection of the seeds is initiated at the time of emergence of the panicle It is reported to occur in severe forms in many parts of South India, including Madurai district in Tamil Nadu, Wynaad in Kerala and Kollegal and South Kanara districts in Karnataka. Distorted Panicle with White Mycelium and Conidia Panicle Emerge as Straight Dirty Coloured Cylindrical Rods as Udbathi Top Identification of pathogen Perfect Stage: Balansia oryzae â sativae. Hashioka. (Subdivision: Ascomycotina; Order: Sphaeriales; Family: Hypocreaceae). The perfect stage of the fungus is an Ascoycete, Balansia oryzae-sativa. Disease Cycle: The fungus is seed-borne externally and systemic. The presence of lustrous grayish white films of fungal growth in young leaves of the infected seedlings suggest the entry of the pathogen during germination of the seeds. As no grains are obtained from aggected heads, diseased seeds are not important in perpetuation of the disease. The fungus has been recorded on the grasses Isachne elegans, Cynadon dactylon, Pennisetum sp., and Eragrostis tenuifolia and they serve as collateral hosts. The disease incidence is less severe on very early and late sown crops. Factors favoring disease development Presence of the bacteria on leaves and in the water or those surviving in the debris left after harvest Warm temperature and high humidity Early stage of planting from maximum tillering to panicle initiation Ascomycete of Euphelis Oryzae Microscopic View of Fungus Ephelis Oryzae Top Management Strategies Use disease free seeds for sowing. Seed treatment with Captan or Thiram. Hot water treatment of the seeds at 50-540 C for 10 minutes before sowing gives effective control of the disease.

Soil solarization with 50 â 100Âµ clear polythene sheets for 3 weeks before preparation of fields. Bare fallow period and planting cover crops such as sesame and cowpea has been reported to decrease nematodes. Rotation crop like marigold (Tagetes sp.) is also effective in lowering root knot nematode populations because of its nematicidal properties. Resistant varieties such as IR cultivars can be grown. Nematicides applied as soil drenches and seedling root dips or seed soaks to reduce nematode populations. Seeds can be treated with EPN and carbofuran. The roots can be dipped in systemic chemicals such as oxamyl or fensulfothion, phorate, carbofuran, and DBCP. Telone can be injected into the soil before the crop is planted.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pathogen Management Strategies Golden Apple Snails Symptoms Missing seedlings Floating of cut leaves Cut stems Decreased plant stand Sparse or uneven stand Nature of damage The golden apple snails rasp plant tissue and cut of stems with their file-like radula or horny tongue. The golden apple snail is considered a major problem in direct-seeded rice. During dry periods or drought, the golden apple snails remain inactive in rice fields. Missing hills in transplanted paddy Presence of snails in field Top Identification of pest The golden apple snail has a muddy brown shell. The shell is lighter than the darker and smaller native snails. Its succulent flesh is creamy white to golden pinkish or orange-yellow. The male has a convex operculum that curves out or away from the shell, whereas the female lid curves into the shell. Neonates or the newly hatched snails have soft shell. The juveniles or young snails are <1.5 to 1.6 cm. Medium-sized snails have a shell height of 2 to 3 cm. The eggs are bright pink or strawberry pink. With age, they lighten in color or turn light pink when about to hatch. Factors favouring pest development wetland and dryland habitats irrigation canals and rivers presence of alternate hosts presence of young seedlings continuous flooding of the rice fields presence of both gills and lung-breathing organs ability to survive in any environmental condition golden Apple snail snail egg Top Management Strategies Mechanical Control Increase mortality by mechanical action. Install screens with 5 mm mesh at water inlets. This can minimize the entry of snails into the rice fields and will also facilitate hand-collection. Handpicking and crushing, staking with bamboo or other wooden stakes before and after transplanting can be practiced to facilitate egg mass collection. Use of a hand-operated device to smash egg clusters between two snail egg clappers can also reduce the snail population. Hand pick and crush the snail egg Collect and kill by mechanical action Cultural methods Planting older seedlings, planting at higher densities, or planting on ridges above the water line are advised against the golden apple snail. The field can be leveled-off or hydrotiller or rototiller to prepare the land. An off-season tillage to crush snails can also be employed. Snails can also be exposed to sun. Draining the field is also advised. Crop rotation with a dryland crop and fallow periods is also recommended as control. For easier drainage and collection of the golden apple snail, canalets can be constructed along bunds and inside paddyfield. Atractants like newspaper can be used. Good water management obtained by good levelling for the first two weeks is recommended. Off season tillage to crush snails Draining the field Chemical methods Molluscicides such as metaldehyde is recommended. Molluscicide-metaldehyde Biological methods The use of common carp, Japanese crucian, heron, and weasels as biological control agents against the golden apple snail. A firefly nymph is also an effective natural enemy of the snail. Herding ducks and raising fish in the paddy are also recommended as biological control. Birds prey on both eggs and neonates.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pathogen Management Strategies White Tip Nematode Symptoms This nematode is widely distributed in Tamil Nadu Feeding at leaf tips in rice results in whitening of the top 3-5 cm of the leaf, leading to necrosis known as "White Tip". Tips of developing leaves become twisted and crinkled. Diseased plants are stunted, lack vigor and produce small panicles. Affected panicles show high sterility, distorted glumes and small and distorted kernels. In extreme cases the affected grains become chaffy. When nematode carrying seeds are sown, the immature forms become active, move up the plant along a thin film of moisture and feed on the foliage ectoparasitically. Twisted and crinkled leaf tips Whitening and necrosis of leaf tips- white tip Top Identification of pest Aphelenchoides besseyi is best known as the causal agent of white tip disease of rice. It is a facultative ecto- and endoparasite of the leaves and young tissues of rice. The nematode is seed borne and can survive in a state of anhydrobiosis for several years on stored grain, but much less under field conditions. Reproduction is usually amphimictic, the life cycle taking 8 days at 23Â° C. It is characterized by a large metacorpus (median bulb), and esophageal glands usually overlapping dorsally. Ithas a slender body 0.44-0.84 mm long and 14-22 Î¼m wide. In females, the excretory pore is usually near the anterior edge of the nerve ring. Male reproductive structures have no bursa and the spicules. Aphelenchoides besseyi White tip nematode Top Management Strategies Resistant varieties such as TPS 1, TPS 2 can be grown. Presoaking overnight and sun drying for 12 hours at 6 hrs/day for two days, two or three days prior to sowing to denematize the seeds. Hot water treatment of seed with 52 -53 degree C for 15 minutes can be used to destroy this nematode infecting the seeds. Apply carbofuran 3G in nursery @ 1.0 kg a.i/ha 7 days before transplanting. Apply cartaphydrochloride @ 1.0 kg a.i/ha at 45 DAT Aphelenchoides besseyi infestations can be avoided by using nematode-free seeds and planting in nematode-free planting material. Destruction of infected source of inoculum like seeds,weeds,debris left after harvest in field Chemical treatments of seed with Benomyl or Thiabendazole is being effective in controllingnematodes. Spraying of infested crop with Parathion (.025%) and Trichlorophos (0.03%) three times has been found to be effective.

An insect may be a pest at one place but may not be so at another place. Insects injure plants by feeding on them and laying eggs in plant tissues. Losses from insect feeding may be direct or indirect. An orbitary limit of a pest population responsible to cause 5 per cent loss in any crops yield, is called the pest status. Insects that cause a loss of 5 to 10 per cent are considered minor pests and those that cause a loss of 10 per cent and above are considered to be major pests. Copyright Â© TNAU | All Rights Reserved
Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pest Management Strategies Brown plant hopper Symptom of Damage : Hopperburn or yellowing, browning and drying of plant. Circular patches of drying and lodging of matured plant. Nymphs and adults congregate at the base of the plant above the water level. Affected plant dries up and gives a scorched appearance called âhopper burnâ. It is vector of grassy stunt, ragged stunt and wilted stunt diseases. Hopper burn caused by the plant hoppers is distinguished from other hopper burn symptom by the presence of visible sooty molds at the bases of the rice plant. Virus infected plants may also be found. Nature of Damage : Both the nymphs and adults remain at the ground level and suck the plant sap. It is a typical vascular feeder primarily sucking phloem sap leading to hopper burn. At early infestation, circular yellow patches appear which soon turn brownish due to the drying up of the plants. The patches of infestation then may spread out and cover the entire field. The grain setting is also affected to a great extent. During sustained feeding, it excretes a large amount of honeydew. Circular dry patches in field Completely withered and desapped plant Hopper burn symptom Presence of Brown plant hopper nymphs and adults Top Identification of pest : Scientific Name - Nilaparvata lugens Egg : Eggs are laid in a group of 2 to 12 in leaf sheath (near the plant base or in the ventral midribs of leaf blades). White, transparent, slender cylindrical and curved eggs are thrust in straight-line in two rows. (They are covered with a dome - shaped egg plug secreted by the female. Only the tips protrude from the plant surface). Nymph : Freshly hatched nymph is cottony white, 0.6 mm long and it turns purple-brown, 3.0 mm long in the fifth instar. Adult : Adult hopper is 4.5-5.0 mm long and has a yellowish brown to dark brown body. The wings are sub hyaline with a dull yellowish tint. It has two characteristic wing morphs: macropterous (long winged) and brachypterous (short winged). Egg Nymph Adult Adult Top Management Strategies: Cultural Methods: Draining the rice field for 3-4 days is recommended during the early stage of infestation. Nitrogen application can be split to reduce Brown plant hopper buildup. Synchronous planting within 3 weeks of staggering and maintaining a free-rice period could also decrease the build-up of Brown plant hopper. There are varieties released by IRRI, which contain genes for Brown plant hopper resistance, like IR26, IR64, IR36, IR56, and IR72. Use resistant varieties like PY 3, CO 42, ADT 35, ADT 37, PTB 33 and PTB 21, Aruna, Kanaka, Karthika, Krishnaveni, Makon, Abhey, Asha, Divya.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pest Management Strategies White backed plant hopper Symptom of Damage : Suck the sap and cause stunted growth. âHopper burnâ is caused in irregular patches. Nature of Damage : White backed plant hopper is more abundant during the early stage of the growth of rice crop, especially in nurseries. Rice is more sensitive to attack at the tillering phase than at the boot and heading stages. Damage is caused through feeding and oviposition. Gravid females cause ovipositional punctures in leaf sheaths. Both nymphs and adults suck phloem sap causing reduced vigour, stunting, yellowing of leaves and delayed tillering and grain formation. Rice crop fails to produce complete grains [seedless glumes] and this condition is known as red disease. Feeding puncture and lacerations caused by ovipositor predispose the plants to pathogenic organisms and honeydew excretion encourages the growth of sooty mould. Circular dry patches in field Completely desapped plant Hopper burn symptom Presence of nymphs and adults Top Identification of pest : Scientific Name - Sogatella furcifera Egg : Cylindrical eggs are laid in groups when the rice plant is small but in the upper part of the rice plant when the plant is large. Nymph : White to a strongly mottled dark grey or black and white in colour and 0.6 mm size when young. Fifth instar nymph with a narrow head and white or creamy white body. Dorsal surface of the thorax and abdomen marked with various amounts of grey and white markings. Adult : The adult hopper is 3.5 - 4.0 mm long. The forewings are uniformly hyaline with dark veins. There is a prominent white band between the junctures of the wings. Macropterous males and females and brachypterous females are commonly found in the field.

Adults or late nymphal stage aestivate in cracks in bunds. Black bug Adult Adult Top Management Strategies: 10% damage at tillering stage or 5 bugs / hill. Maintain a clean field by removing the weeds and drying the rice field during ploughing. Rice varieties of the same maturity date may be planted to break the insectâs cycle. Direct-seeded rice crops tend to have less tillers in one planting point and thus discourage population growth. Flooding the fields can also cause higher egg mortality. Set up light trap during the full moon period to attract large number of bugs and kill. Conserve the predators viz Spiders, coccinellids and wasps to check the pest. Ducks can be allowed in the field to pick up the bugs. Spray acephate 625 g / ha (or) Neem seed kernal extract 5% for effective control of black bug.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Symptom of Damage Identification of pest Management Strategies Ear head bug Symptom of Damage : Sucking the sap from individual grains, which are in milky stage. Due to de-sapping, grains show brownish discoloured patches on the husk. Individual grains become chaffy and erect panicles. Black spots on the grains at the site of feeding puncture. In the case of heavy infestation, the whole ear head may become devoid of mature grains. Buggy odour in rice field during milky stage. Obnoxious odour eminates on disturbing the bugs. Nature of Damage : Both adults and nymphs do the damage. The nymphs start feeding 3 to 4 hours after hatching. They feed on the leaf sap near the tip / on milky sap in developing spikelets at milky stage. Sucking of the milky sap causes ill-filled / partial filled and chaffy grains. . They omit bad smell hence they are called Gundhi bugs. Serious infestation can reduce the yield by 50%. The straw gives off-flavour that is unattractive to the cattle. Feeding injuries and spots on grains Chaffy and erect panicles Infected leaves roll inwards along the margins Terminal rolling and drying of leaves Top Identification of pest : Scientific Name - Leptocorisa acuta Egg : Eggs are circular, brownish seed like, 2 mm long, laid in clusters in two rows along the midrid on the upper surface of the leaf-blade.

Crop Protection HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Pest Disease Non - Insect Pest Crop Protection Experts assessment reveal that around 22 per cent of yield losses in Rice can be attributed to insect pests. Hence, there is need to reduce if not eliminate these losses by protecting the crops from different pests through appropriate techniques. At present day the role of crop protection in agriculture is of great importance and a challenging process than before, as the so called resistant species should be brought under check. All other management practices of crop husbandry will be futile if the crop is not protected against the ravages of pests. In absence of crop protection the yields may be drastically declined. The entire effort of growing a crop will be defeated in absence of crop protection resulting in financial loss to the grower. So the crop protection against various pests is a must in agriculture.

Cultivation Practices HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Main Field Preparation Crop stand Establishment Water Management Weed Management Cropping System Cultivation Practices Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.

Cultivation Practices >> Main field Preparation HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Sub Topics Soil conditions Required Tillage practices Main field preparation in Tamil Nadu Main field preparation in Kerala Main field preparation in Karnataka Laser Levelling Main Field Preparation Soil Condition Required Soils with good water retention capacity with high amount of clay and organic matter are ideal for rice cultivation. Clay or clay loams are most suited for rice cultivation. Such soils are capable of holding water for long and sustain crop. Rice being a semi-aquatic crop, grows best under sub-merge conditions. Rice is cultivated in almost all types of soils with varying productivity. The major soil groups where rice is grown are riverine alluvium, red-yellow, red loamy, hill and sub-montane, Terai, laterite, costal alluvium, red sandy, mixed red, black, medium and shallow black soils. It grows well in soils having a pH range between 5.5 and 6.5. Special technologies for problem soils : For fluffy paddy soils: compact the soil by passing 400kg stone roller or oil-drum with stones inside, eight times at proper moisture level (moisture level at friable condition of soil which is approximately 13 to18%) once in three years to prevent the sinking of draught animals and workers during puddling. For sodic soils: For sodic soils with pH values of more than 8.5, plough at optimum moisture regime, apply 50% of total gypsum requirement uniformly, impound water, provide drainage for leaching out soluble salts and apply green leaf manure at 5 t/ha, 10 to 15 days before transplanting. Mix 37.5kg of Zinc sulphate per ha with sand to make a total quantity of 75kg and spread the mixture uniformly on the leveled field. Do not incorporate the mixture in the soil. Rice under sodic soil responds well to these practices. For saline soils: For saline soils with EC values of more than 4 dS/m, provide lateraland main drainage channels (60cm deep and 45cm wide), apply green leaf manure at 5 t/ha at 10 to 15 days before transplanting and 25% extra dose of nitrogen in addition to recommended P and K and ZnSo4 at 37.5 kg/ha at planting For acid soils: For acid soils apply lime based on the soil analysis for obtaining normal rice yields. Lime is applied @ 2.5t/ha before last ploughing. Apply lime at this rate to each crop upto the 5th crop. Top Tillage Practices Primary tillage Ploughing Ploughing is the primary tillage operations, which is performed to cut, break and invert the soil partially or completely suitable for sowing seeds. Special technologies for problem soils To obtain a deep seed bed of good texture. To increase the water holding capacity of the soil. To improve soil aeration. To destroy weeds, insects and pests. To add fertility to the soil by covering vegetation. Secondary tillage Harrowing Harrowing is a secondary tillage operation which is done to a shallow depth for smoothening and pulverizing the soil as well as to cut the weeds and to mix the materials with the soil. Purpose of harrowing To pulverize the soil of the seedbeds in the field. To destroy grasses and seeds in the field. To cut crop residues and mix them with top soil of the field. To break the big clods and to make the field surface uniform and levelled. Harrowing is carried out when the moisture content of the clods are reduced. Puddling Puddling is churning the soil with water. It is done in paddy fields with standing water of 5-10 cm depth after initial ploughing with country plough. It breaks up the clods and churns the soil. Purpose of puddling To reduce leaching of water or decrease percolation of water, To kill the weeds by decomposition. To facilitate transplantation of paddy seedlings by making the soil softer. To decrease water and nutrient losses by reduced hydraulic conductivity. Levelling Land levelling is expected to bring permanent improvement in the value of land. Levelling work is carried out to modify the existing contours of land for efficient agricultural production system Purpose of Levelling Efficient application of irrigation water and increased conservation of rain water. Improve surface drainage and minimize soil erosion Provision of an adequate field size and even topography for efficient mechanisation. Perfect land leveling for efficient weed and water management. Improves better crop stands and crop establishment Top Main Field Preparation in Tamil Nadu Transplanted Rice Plough the land during summer to economize the water requirement for initial preparation of land. Field is ploughed once or twice to obtain a good tilth. Flood the field 1 or 2 days before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface of the field covered with water. Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling. Apply 12.5 t of FYM or compost or green leaf manure @ 6.25 t/ha. If green manure is raised @ 20 kg/ha in situ, incorporate it to adepth of 15 cm using a green manure trampler or tractor. Apply 22 kg urea/ha at the time of first puddling while incorporating the stubbles of previous crop to compensate immobilization of N by the stubbles. This may be done at least 10 days prior to planting of subsequent crop. For SRI, 4-5 ploughing is required for preparing the land & in the last ploughing, we need to ensure it is upto a depth of 6 inches. Perfect levelling is a pre requisite for the water management in SRI. Direct Seeded Rice Wet seeded rice On receipt of showers during the month of May-July repeated ploughing should be carried out so as to conserve the moisture, destroy the weeds and break the clods. After inundation puddling is to be done as per transplanting. More care should be taken to level the field to zero level. Stagnation of water in patches during germination and early establishment of the crop leads to uneven crop stand. Land leveling helps in efficient weed and water management practices. Provision of shallow trenches (15cm width) at an interval of 3m all along the field will facilitate the draining of excess water at the early growth stage. Dry seeded rice Dry plough to get fine tilth taking advantage of rains and soil moisture availability. Apply gypsum @ 1t/ha basally where soil crusting and soil hardening problem exist. Perfect land leveling for efficient weed and water management practices. Provision of shallow trenches (15cm width) at an interval of 3m all along the field will facilitate the draining of excess water at the early growth stage. Top Main Field Preparation in Kerala General Plough the field thoroughly to incorporate the weeds and straw into the soil. Ensure a smooth, level field for transplanting the seedlings. Apply organic manure in the form of farmyard manure or compost or green leaf @ of 5t/ha and incorporate into the soil while ploughing. The entire quantity of phosphatic fertilizers may be applied along with the organic manures. Kuttanad In Kuttanad, land lies below the sea level, the paddy fields situated along the waterways need to be protected by strong and carefully designed ring bunds. Construction of outer walls called ring bunds (puravarambu) around the particular portion of a shallow water body and draining the enclosed area by bailing water out of that enclosed portion at the beginning of every crop season. Plough the field thoroughly to incorporate the weeds in the field. Ensure a smooth and levelled field. Maintain a thin film of water to facilitate sowing so that the germinated seeds do not get covered with clayey soil, which affects seedling establishment. Kole For the first crop in Kole, after the cessation of the heavy monsoon, dewatering is effected by petti and para or centrifugal pump and rarely by chakkram. Land is ploughed thoroughly and transplanting is done. For the second crop, land is prepared thoroughly and direct sowing of sprouted seeds or transplanting is done. Onattukara With the onset of pre-monsoon showers, land is ploughed thoroughly. Dibbling of unsprouted seeds behind the country plough is the common practice. Pokkali The rice is cultivated from June to early November when the salinity level of the water in the fields is low. From mid-November to mid-April, when the salinity is high, prawn farming takes over after the rice harvest, feed on the leftovers of the harvested crop. By April, the bunds are being strengthened, fields are drained during low tide and sluices repaired for regulating water level. No other fertilizer or manure need in rice crop because of nutrients drawn from the prawnsâ excrement and other remnants. Harvesting takes place by end-October. Only the panicles are cut and the rest of the stalks are left to decay in the water, which in time become feed for the prawns that start arriving in NovemberâDecember. Top Main Field Preparation in Karnataka The main field is to be dry ploughed for twice three weeks before planting. Later, field may be ploughed with 5-10 cm of standing water 2-3 times. This process is known as puddling Incorporate 5-7 tonne of FYM or compost or 1 tonne of poultry manure per hectare or incorporate 10 tonne of green leaf manure three weeks before transplanting. The fertilizers recommended for basal application have to be applied before the last puddling and incorporated. After fertilization avoid moving of water from one field to another. Later, proper levelling has to be made before transplanting the seedlings. Dig the corners of field which are not covered by ploughing. Cut off 2.5 cm of soil from the top and sides of the bunds to remove the weeds along with their seeds and to destroy the eggs of insect pests by using spade. If the bunds are very broad, trim them to a width of 15 cm and height of 15 cm so that rats do not harbor in the bunds. If rat burrows are noticed, insert pellets of 0.5 g or 0.6 g aluminium phosphide and plug the exit holes. Apply mud paste to the side and top of the bund to a thickness of 2.5 cm with a spade and plaster it using the flat surface of the spade. Plastering the bunds helps in checking weed growth and prevents harboring of insect pests. Top Laser Levelling LASER GUIDED LAND LEVELING : Laser land leveling is leveling the field within certain degree of desired slope using a guided laser beam throughout the field. Unevenness of the soil surface has a significant impact on the germination, stand and yield of crops. Farmers also recognize this and therefore devote considerable time resources in leveling their fields properly. However, traditional methods of leveling land are cumbersome, time consuming as well as expensive. WHY LASER LEVELING ?: Land looks leveled but even then wide topographic variation exists. Wide variability in crop yields at field/ village/ block/ district/ regional level. For better distribution of water. For water savings. For improvement in nutrient use efficiencies. Option for Precision Farming Higher crop productivity OBJECTIVES OF LAND LEVELING : Effective land leveling is meant to optimize water use efficiency, improve crop establishment, reduce the irrigation time and effort required to manage crop. Laser leveled land: Saves 25-30% of water Improves crop establishment and improves yield. Reduces weed problems Improves uniformity of crop maturity Decreases the time to complete tasks Reduces the amount of water required for land preparation. ECONOMICS : The initial cost of laser land leveling is high but if the appropriate ploughing techniques are used, re-levelling the whole field should not be necessary for at least eight to ten years. Measurements taken in fields in the second and third year after leveling have shown very little variation in surface topography. Other benefits are: Being able to direct seed. Plough the field on time. Harvest evenly ripened crop. Reduced weeding cost. EQUIPMENT DETAILS : Top Copyright Â© TNAU | All Rights Reserved
Cultivation Practices >> Crop Stand Establishment HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Sub Topics Principles of Crop Establishment System of Rice Intensification (SRI) Transplanting Direct wet seeding Direct dry seeding Seedling Throwing Method Crop Stand Establishment Principles of Crop Establishment General goal: Establish a uniform plant stand. For maximum yield, plant stand must be uniform across the field. Transplanting gives a good stand establishment Direct seeding, especially wet direct seeding, may be problematic. If direct seed then i. Need more uniform land leveling and better water management ii. Seed planted too deep results in poor emergence and weak plants System of Rice Intensification (SRI) Seed Rate 7-8 kg/ha for transplanting single seedling per hill. 12-15 kg/ha for transplanting two seedlings per hill wherever difficulty in establishment of rice is seen. 15 days old seedlings are transplanted with 1-2 seedlings per hill. Transplant within 30 minutes of pulling out of seedlings. A commonly practiced methods are Using rope with marking Using aluminium pipes with markings. Using bamboo plank with pegs as markings Using wooden marker Using roller markers Fill up the gaps between 7th and 10th DAT. There may be difficulty in crop establishment in areas with heavy downpour (North East Monsoon periods of Tamil Nadu). Transplanting : Transplanting consists of preparing seedlings in nursery and then planting these seedlings in the prepared main field. Transplanting ensures a uniform plant stand and gives the rice crop a head start over emerging weeds. Seedling Management Optimum age of seedlings for quick establishment Optimum age of the seedlings for transplanting is 18-22 days for short duration, 25-30 days for medium duration and 35-40 days for long duration varieties. Pulling out the seedlings Pull out the seedlings at the appropriate time (4th leaf stage). These seedlings can produce more tillers, provided enough care is given during the establishment phase by providing thin film of water and perfect levelled of main field. Transplanting after 5th leaf and higher order leaf numbers will affect the performance of the crop and grain yield. They are called as âaged seedlingsâ. Management of Aged seedlings Follow the spacing recommended to medium and low fertility soil Avoid cluster planting of aged seedlings, which are hindering the formation of new tillers. To encourage the tiller production, enhance the basal N application by 50% from the recommended dose. Root dipping Prepare the slurry with 5 packets (1000 g)/ha of Azospirillum and 5 packets (1000g/ha) of Phosphobacteria or 10 packets of (2000g/ha) of Azophos inoculant in 40 lit. of water and dip the root portion of the seedlings for 15 - 30 minutes in bacterial suspension and then transplant. Plant Density and Spacing In Tamil Nadu Varietal duration Low and Medium Fertility (plant/ha) Spacing (cm) High Fertility Plants / ha Spacing (cm) Short 8 lakhs 12.5 x 10 5.0 lakhs 20x10 Medium 5.0 lakhs 20x10 3.3 lakhs 20x15 Long 3.3 lakhs 20x15 2.5 lakhs 20x20 In Kerala Season Duration Spacing No.of hills/m2 First crop Medium Short 20 cm x 15 cm 15 cm x 10 cm 33 67 Second crop Medium Short 20 cm x 10 cm 15 cm x 10 cm 50 67 Third crop Medium Short 20 cm x 10 cm 15 cm x 10 cm 50 67 Optimum age of seedlings: Optimum age of the seedlings for transplanting is 18 days for short duration, 20-25 days for medium duration and 30 days for long duration varieties. In Karnataka Spacing: 20x10cm (50 hills/ sq.meter) 2-3 seedlings per hill Short duration variety: 15x10cm (67 hills/ sq. meter) In Tungabhadra command area, for transplanting of long duration varieties such as sona masuri under delayed condition (August 15-30th) select the seedlings which are 45 days old and transplant about 3 to 4 seedlings per hill to get higher yield. Planting Seedling in the main field Number of seedlings /hill 2 to 4 seedlings / hill Saline soil : 4 to 6 seedling / hill Depth of Planting Clay soil : 5 to 6 cm Shallow soil : 2.5 to 3.0 cm Shallow planting (3 cm) ensures quick establishment and more tillers. Deeper planting (> 5cm) leads to delayed establishment and reduced tillers. Transplanting shock: It occurs when the seedlings are pulled out from the nursery and planted in the new environment. For recovery from shock, it will take minimum of 5 to 7 days under tropics. Shallow planting reduces the period. Mild temperature after transplanting also reduces the period. Hot and very cold weather delays recovery. Best temperature: <30Â° C maximum and > 20Â° C minimum. Gap filling Fill the gaps, if any within 7 - 10 days after transplanting. Top Transplanting Methods Types : Manual transplanting Machine transplanting Manual transplanting Manual transplanting is most suited for labour-surplus areas and for small rice fields. Manual transplanting can be done in fields with less than optimal levelling and with varying water levels. How to Transplant Rice Manually Pull out the seedlings at an average of 15 to 30 days after seeding (DAS) from nurseries and transport them to the main field. In a modified mat nursery, seedlings are ready for transplanting at 15-20 DAS and seedling mats are transported to main field. Transplant the seedlings soon after pulling from the nursery in puddled, leveled field (any delay will lead to slow revival and even death of some seedlings). Transplant 2-3 seedlings per hill at shallow depth at optimum spacing (20 cm x 20 cm or 22.5 cm x 22.5 cm). Handle seedlings carefully to ensure their fast revival and rapid growth after transplanting. Limitations : Transplanting is tedious and time-consuming (up to 30 person-days ha-1). Difficult to get enough labour at peak periods to plant on time. Low plant density with contract transplanting on area basis lowers yields. Risk, in rainfed areas, that seedlings (especially of modern varieties) may get too old before rain starts. Machine transplanting Machine transplanting involves planting young rice seedlings into puddled soil by machine. How to Transplant Rice by Machine? Raise seedlings in special mat nurseries or in seedling trays. Use required quantity of good seed per 100 m2 of nursery for each ha. Seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 12-15 days after seeding (DAS). Ensure that fields are well puddled and leveled. Drain fields and allow mud to settle for 1-2 days after the final puddling. The subsurface soil layers need to be hard enough to support the transplanting machine. The soil is ready when a small âVâ mark made in the puddled soil with a stick holds its shape. At this moisture level, the soil can hold the seedlings upright. Soil should not be so dry that it sticks to and interferes with planting parts or wheels of the transplanter. Load the seedling mats on the machine and transplant the seedlings at the selected machine setting. Advantages Machine transplanting requires considerably less time and labour than manual transplanting (1-2 ha/person/day versus 0.07 ha/person/day). Fast and efficient (1-2 ha/day), and ensures timely planting. Reduces stress, drudgery and health risks. Ensures uniform spacing and plant density. Seedlings recover fast, tiller vigorously, and mature uniformly. Limitations Seedlings must be planted while still young, and so mechanical transplanting is best suited for irrigated areas only. Special nursery management is needed (mat nursery or seedling trays). Good land preparation, leveling and water management are required. Top Direct Wet Seeding Seed rate â 60 kg/ha. Pre germinate the seeds as for wet nursery. Sow the seeds by drum seeder or broadcast uniformly with thin jfilm of water. Thinning and gap filling should be done 14-21 days after sowing. Dual cropping of rice-green manure is economic for nutrient budget and efficient for grain production. For this method use âTNAU Rice-Green manure seederâ. If dual cropped with green manure, incorporate the green manure when grown to 40cm height or at 30 days after sowing, whichever is earlier, using Cono-weeder. Green manure incorporated fields may be operated again with rotary weeder a week later in order to aerate the soil and to exploit organic acids formed if any. Top Direct Dry Seeding In Tamil Nadu : Seed rate: 75 kg/ha dry seed for any recommended variety. Seed hardening with 1% KCl for 16 hours (seed and KCl solution 1:1) and shade dried to bring to storable moisture. This will enable the crop to withstand early moisture stress. On the day of sowing, treat the hardened seeds first with Pseudomonas fluroscens 10g/kg of seed and then with Azophos 2000 g or Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria @ 600 g each per ha seed, whichever is available. Drill sow with 20 cm inter row spacing using seed drill. In Kerala : Seed rate Broadcasting 80-100 kg/ha Dibbling 80-90 kg/ha [Note: The above seed rates are specified for farmers' field on the basis of minimum germination of 80%. In pokkali cultivation, for Vyttila varieties, 100 kg/ha may be sown on the beds or mounds formed in the field. In Karnataka : Seed rate â 100 kg/ha Possible to obtain higher yields with direct sowing of rice. Direct sowing of rice is preferred to transplanting rice in areas with low water availability. Direct seeding is a viable option in areas with shortage of water and labour. Large scale adoption of direct sowing is possible. Sowing of Paddy using drum seeder : Followed under late sown conditions especially in the month of July when rainfall is sufficient enough to make puddling. Use pre-germinated seeds for sowing Seed rate - 40 kg/ha Top Seedling Throwing Method 20 days old seedlings of short duration rice varieties. Requirement of seedlings will be approximately 20% more than the line planting or equal to random planting. The seedlings are thrown into the puddled leveled field by labour without using force. Suitable for all seasons except Thaladi or heavy rain season. 50% labour shaving as compared to line planting and 35% to random planting. Up to 7-10 days of seedling throwing care should be taken to maintain thin film of water (similar to wet seeded rice). Other cultural operations are same as transplanted rice. Grain yield will be equal to line planted crop and 10-12% higher than random planted crop. Top Copyright Â© TNAU | All Rights Reserved
Cultivation Practices >> Water Management HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Sub Topics Water requirement Water management for different ecosystem Critical stages of irrigation Water management methods Components of Water losses from rice field Water stress Water Management Water Requirement Crop water requirement is the water required by the plants for its survival, growth, development and to produce economic parts. This requirement is applied either naturally by precipitation or artificially by irrigation. Average Water requirement â 1100 mm Average Water requirement (SRI) â 700 mm The daily consumptive use of rice varies from 6-10 mm and total water is ranges from 1100 to 1250 mm depending upon the agro climatic situation, duration of variety and characteristics of the soils. Stage-wise water requirement for paddy Stages of growth Water requirement (mm) Precentage of total water requirement Nursery 40 3.22 Main field preparation 200 16.12 Planting to panicle initiation 458 37.00 Panicle initiation to flowering 417 33.66 Flowering to maturity 125 10.00 Operation wise water requirement of paddy : Operation Water requirement (mm) Nursery 40 Land preparation 200 Field irrigation 1000 Total 1240 Scheduling of irrigation for paddy Short duration variety Medium duration variety Long duration variety Days No. of irrigation Water level (cm) Days No. of irrigation Water level (cm) Days No. of irrigation Water level (cm) 1-25 5-7 2-3 1-30 5-7 2-3 1-35 6-8 2-3 25 - Thin film of water 30 - Thin film of water 35 - Thin film of water 28 - Life irrigation 33 - Life irrigation 38 - Life irrigation 29-50 6 2-5 34-65 6-8 2-5 39-90 or 95 12-15 2-5 51-70 5-6 2-5 66-95 8-10 2-5 96-125 7-9 2-5 71-105 5-6 2-5 96-125 6-8 2-5 126-150 5-6 2-5 Top Water Management for Different Ecosystem System of Rice Intensification (SRI) Irrigation only to moist the soil in the early period of 10 days Restoring irrigation to a maximum depth of 2.5cm after development of hairline cracks in the soil until panicle initiation Increasing irrigation depth to 5.0 cm after PI one day after disappearance of ponded water. Transplanted lowland rice Puddling and leveling minimizes the water requirement Plough with tractor drawn cage wheel to reduce percolation losses and to save water requirement up to 20%. Maintain 2.5 cm water over the puddle and allow the green manure to decompose for a minimum of 7 days in the case of less fibrous plants like sun hemp and 15 days for more fibrous green manure plants like Kolinchi (Tephrosia purpurea). At the time of transplanting, a shallow depth of 2 cm of water is adequate since high depth of water will lead to deep planting resulting in reduction of tillering. Maintain 2 cm of water up to seven days of transplanting. After the establishment stage, cyclic submergence of water is the best practice for rice crop. This cyclic 5 cm submergence has to be continued throughout the crop period. Moisture stress due to inadequate water at rooting and tillering stage causes poor root growth leading to reduction in tillering, poor stand and low yield. Wet Seeded Puddled Lowland Rice During first one week just wet the soil by thin film of water. Depth of irrigation may be increased to 2.5cm progressively along the crop age. Provide adequate drainage facilities to drain excess water or strictly follow irrigation schedule of one day after disappearance of ponded water. Last irrigation may be 15 days ahead of harvest. Dry Seeded Un-Puddled Rice As that of irrigated rice, canal water is used for irrigation For drill sown rice care should be taken to drain out excess rain water during first 10-15 DAS and the water level in the field should not be more than 2.5cm height during tillering stage. In drill sown rice carry out hodta operation (Planking) in standing water at 40 DAS, and impound sufficient rain water through the crop growth period. Semi-dry rice The crop is irrigated from 30-35 days onwards, utilizing water impounded in the tanks. Irrigation may be to a depth of 2.5 -5.0cm only. Follow the schedule of one day after disappearance of ponded water in order to save water and to bring additional area under this type of rice cultivation. Precautions for irrigation (common) The field plot can be 25 to 50 cents depending on the source of irrigation. Field to field irrigation should be avoided. Small bund may be formed parallel to the main bund of the field at a distance of 30 to 45cm within the field to avoid leakages of water through main bund crevices. To minimize percolation loss, the depth of stagnated water should be 5cm or less. In water logged condition, form open drains, about 60cm in depth and 45cm width across the field. Care should be taken not to allow development of cracks. In double cropped wetland of command area, raise groundnut / pulse in the place of Kuruvai rice if water is a constraint. Top Critical Stages of Irrigation The stage at which the water stress causes severe yield reduction is also known as critical stage of water requirement. It is also known as moisture sensitive period. Critical stages of water requirement in rice are Active tillering Panicle initiation Booting Heading and Flowering. During theses stages, the irrigation interval should not exceed the stipulated time so as to cause the depletion of moisture below the saturation level. Top Water Management Methods Continuous Submergence Continuous land submergence for rice is, usually, practiced due to the associated major advantages of increase in availability of nutrients and less weed management problems. Shallow submergence of water up to 5 cm depth throughout the crop period is optimum for high yield. Depth of submergence at different stages Stages of crop growth Depth of submergence (cm) At transplanting 2 After transplanting for 3 days 5 Three days after transplanting upto maximum tillering 2 At maximum tillering (in fertile fields only) Drain water for three days Maximum tillering to panicle initiation 2 Panicle initiation to 21 days after flowering 5 Twenty one days after flowering Withhold irrigation Intermittent Submergence Continuous land submergence requires huge quantity of water for rice production, so to minimize the irrigation requirement, the approach of intermittent submergence has been practiced. Under high humidity and low evaporative demand, the practice of intermittent submergence i.e submergence during the critical stages of crop and maintenance of saturation or drying up to hair cracking stage during the rest of the crop stages. Intermittent period varied from one to nine days depending on rainfall pattern, depth of water table and soil texture. This practice saves about 30% water. Continuous Flowing Irrigation Standing water in lowland rice minimize the irrigation needs leading to high water use efficiency compared with continuous flowing irrigation water from field to field. Flowing water from field to field increases grain yield of rice by preventing accumulation of harmful salts in the soil. However, nitrogen losses will be higher with continuous flowing irrigation water. Flowing irrigation water is ideal for problem soils. Rotational Irrigation Required quantity of irrigation water is applied at regular intervals, such that there may not be any standing water in field between two irrigations. Irrigation interval is adjusted in such a way that the crop will not experience water deficits at any period. It is usually followed at time of deficit water supplies. Major advantage of rotational irrigation is possibly the more effective use of rainfall. Shallow submergence is advantageous during critical period of the crop Top Components of Water Losses from Rice Field The principal losses of water from lowland rice fields can be grouped into two: vapour losses and losses in liquid form. Vapour losses are through transpiration from leaf surface and evaporation at water surface collectively referred to as evapotranspiration. The two types of liquid losses are deep percolation plus seepage and runoff of excess water over the field levees Evapotranspiration : Evaporation is highest at early growth stages, when the leaf area index (LAI) is small and accounts for most of the evapotranspiration (ET) losses. In most of the tropics, the ET requirements during wet season, on an average, is 4-5 mm day -1. During the dry season, it is 8-10 mm day-1. Percolation and seepage: Percolation occurs in vertical direction and seepage by horizontal movement through levees. Percolation is largely affected by topography, soil characteristics and depth of water table. In a heavy soil with water table close to the soil surface, percolation loss could be around 1.0 mm day-1 as against as high as 10.0 cm day-1 in light soils. Seepage, normally, flows into soil surface or streams, rivers or drains, while percolation, usually, contribute to water table. Surface runoff It represents a major loss of water in lowland rice production, especially with flowing irrigation water from field to field. When the source of irrigation water is wells, there may not be any surface runoff losses. Surface runoff losses are most severe in wet season especially at times of high intensity rains. Tips to reduce water losses Seepage and percolation reduced to considerable extent by intensive land puddling and perfect leveling Application of FYM or compost or green manures reduce evaporation, percolation and seepage Lining of canals and irrigation channels can be formed to check the seepage. Evaporation losses can be minimized by 50% when the soil is kept at saturation under levelled field conditions Addition of clay or tank silt (to light textured soils only) @ 150m3/ha reduce the percolation loss by 20 -25%. To reduce percolation loss: Growing rice in large blocks rather than in isolated small holdings. Subsoil compaction Rainwater harvesting and levees management can substantially minimize the surface runoff during wet season. Top Water Stress Moisture stress means the action of excess or deficit of water on plants. However, moisture stress is generally used to imply water deficits. Water deficits and rice performance Water deficit occur in the plant whenever transpiration exceeds uptake. The effect of water deficits on growth and yield of rice depend on the stage of crop growth at which the water deficits occur. Vegetative growth stage Immediately after transplanting, adequate land submergence (5 cm) is necessary to prevent damage to establishing seedlings from high winds and for root development. Following the early rooting stage, a shallow depth of land submergence (2 cm) facilitates tiller production and firm root anchorage in the soil. Moisture stress occur at active tillering phase will reduce the yield by 30%. Reproductive stage Rice crop is most sensitive to water deficit from panicle primordial development to heading. Three days of moisture stress at 11 days and at three days before heading results in maximum yield loss due to high percentage of sterility. Moisture stress occur at reproductive phase will reduce the yield by 50 - 60%. Maturity stage This stage (milk to grain maturity) is least sensitive to soil moisture stress. After yellowish ripening stage, there is no necessity for standing water. Water may be drained from the field about 7-10 days before harvest to facilitate harvesting. Water stress management Spray Cycocel @ 1000ppm (1ml of commercial product in one litre of water) under water deficit situations to mitigate ill effects of moisture stress. Split application of potassium 50% at basal and 25% each at tillering and panicle initiation stage along with Azospirillum (seed inoculation, seedling dipping or soil application) alleviates harmful effects of the soil moisture stress. Seed hardening with 1% KCl for 16 hours (seed and KCl solution 1:1) and shade dried to bring to storable moisture. This will enable the crop to withstand early moisture stress. Foliar spray of kaolin 3% or KCl 1% to overcome moisture stress at different physiological stages of rice. Excess water and crop performance Response of rice crop to excess water conditions is different for different growth stages, varieties and seasons. Turbid water greatly damages the crop than clear water. Seedling establishment to maximum tillering stage is least sensitive. Excess water during the vegetative phase hinders tillering. Flowering to maturity is more sensitive to excess water than the stage from maximum tillering to flowering. Fields that are kept flooded beyond the dough stage will mature in a non-homogenous way and harvest will be delayed. Management of Excess Water Levelling of land removes excess water by runoff. Drainage removes excess water from the root zone that is harmful for plant growth. The best time for drainage in ill drained soils is at late tillering stage. Controlled irrigation reduces excess use of water in water-logged area. Flood control measures: Construction of bunds may check water flow from the rivers to the cultivable lands.

Cultivation Practices HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Sub Topics Effects of weeds on paddy cultivation Weed flora in rice field Critical Period of Weed Competition Weed Management methods Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Special Practices for Kerala Weed Management Effects of Weeds on Paddy Cultivation Weeds are unwanted and undesirable plants which interfere with the utilization of land and water resources and thus adversely affect paddy yield. They can also be referred as plants out of place. Weeds are an important factor in the management of all land and water resources, but its effect is greatest on paddy cultivation. Weeds intensify the pest and disease problem by serving as alternate host Reduce the efficiency of harvesting Reduce the land value Problems of water contamination Reduce the yield and quality of paddy by competing for nutrients, water and sunlight. In Transplanted rice : 10-15% reduction in yield In Upland direct seeded rice : 35-45% reduction in yield In Direct seeded on puddle land : 20-25% reduction in yield Weed Flora in Rice Field Grasses Echinocloa crusgalli ssp.

The crop yield level obtained by weeding during this period is almost similar to that obtained by the full seasons weed free conditions. The critical period of weed competition is approximately 1/3rd of the duration of the crop. Crops Critical period (days after sowing) Rice (Transplanted) 15- 45 Upland rice Entire period Top Weed Management Methods Weed control and weed management are the two terms used in weed science. Weed control is the process of limiting infestation of the weed plant so that crops can be grown profitably. Weed management includes prevention, eradication and control by regulated use, restricting invasion, suppression of growth, prevention of seed production and complete destruction. Preventive methods Use of weed free seeds. Use of weed free seed bed. Use clean tools and machinery. Clean irrigation canals and bunds Prevent entry of water-carried vegetative propagules of weeds that are perennial. Eradication methods Eradication can be done by Destroying the species at the initial stage of introduction. Degenerating the buried dormant but viable seeds by flooding Control methods Cultural methods Preparatory cultivation - Incorporates weeds into soil, often to a depth of 10 to 15 cm to destroy the existing weed growth. Flooding and intensive puddling is an added advantage in lowland rice weed management. Cultural practices like dual cropping of rice-azolla and rice-green manure reduces the weed infestation to a greater extent. Summer ploughing and cultivation of irrigated dry crops during post-rainy periods reduces the weed infestation. Soil compaction to a bulk density around 1.8 g cc-1 was very effective for minimizing weed infestation in direct seeded lowland rice. Planting method - transplanting is primarily done for good weed control. Select cultivars which are having greater seedling vigor, leaf area development, early height growth rates, and tillering ability. Adopt greater plant densities to allow the crop canopy to close sooner, reducing weed germination and growth. Top Manual weed control Weeds are removed and collected from crop fields by hand. The collected weeds are piled on bunds or in case of certain weeds, taken home to feed animals. Manual weeding is the most widely used method of weed control in rice which is, however, difficult, time consuming and often costly. Transplanted rice Pulling by hand or using tools like hoe, spade or sickle. Take up one or two hand weeding between 15-40 days after transplanting SRI Manual hand weeding to remove left out weeds after cono weeding Rainfed rice First weeding can be done between 15 and 21 days after germination. Second weeding may be done 30 - 45 days after first weeding Top Mechanical weed control Mechanical control consists of methods that kill or suppress weeds through physical disruption. Such methods include pulling, digging, disking, ploughing and mowing. Transplanted rice Use of rotary weeder four times from 15 DAT at 10 days interval. It saves labour for weeding, aerates the soil and root zone, prolongs the root activity, and improves the grain filling though efficient translocation and ultimately the grain yield. Upland dry seeded rice Repeated intercultivation by passing hoe or small blade harrow 2-3 times between 20-45 days after sowing. SRI Using rotary weeder / Cono weeder Moving the weeder with forward and backward motion to bury the weeds and as well to aerate the soil at 7-10 days interval from 10-15 days after planting on either direction of the rows and column. Manual weeding is also essential to remove the weeds closer to rice root zone Top Chemical weed control Using chemicals, generally referred as herbicides, for the control of weeds is called chemical weed control. Herbicide application can provide the most effective and time-efficient method of managing weeds. Tamil Nadu and Kerala Transplanted rice: Pre-emergence herbicides Use Butachlor 1.25 kg/ha or Anilophos 0.4 kg/ha, Thiobencarb 50 % EC @ 2 kg/ha (1 kg ai/ha), pendimethalin 30 % EC @ 4.5 kg/ha (1.5 kg ai /ha), as pre-emergence application. Alternatively, pre-emergence application of herbicide mixture viz., Butachlor 0.6 kg + 2, 4 DEE 0.75 kg/ha, or Anilophos + 2,4 DEE âready-mixâ at 0.4 kg/ha followed by one hand weeding on 30-35 DAT will have a broad spectrum of weed control. Any herbicide has to be mixed with 50 kg dry sand on the day of application (3-4 DAT) and applied uniformly in the field with thin film water on the 3rd DAT. Water should not be drained for next 2 days from the field (or) fresh irrigation should not be given. Post â emergence herbicides Where broad-leaved weeds and sedges are predominant, apply 2,4-D sodium salt (Fernoxone 80% WP) 1.25 kg/ha dissolved in 625 litres of water with a high volume sprayer, three weeks after transplanting or when the weeds are in 3-4 leaf stage. Wet seeded rice Spray any of the following herbicides: Butachlor 50% EC @ 2.5 kg/ha (1.25 kg ai/ha) or Thiobencarb 50% EC @ 2 kg/ha (1.00 kg ai/ha) 6-9 days after sowing Pretilachlor + safener (sofit) 50% EC@ 2.25 kg/ha (0.45 kg ai/ha) 3-5 days after sowing. Give a follow up application of 2,4-D 3.8% EC @ 3.04 kg/ha (0.8 kg ai/ha) at 20 days after sowing. To control Echinochloa sp. spray cyhalofop butyl 10% EW @ 0.8 kg/ha (0.08 kg ai/ha) at 15-18 days after sowing. Dry seeded rice Spray any of the following pre-emergent herbicides: Thiobencarb 50% EC @ 3 kg/ha (1.5 kg ai/ha), butachlor 50 % EC @ 2.5 kg/ha (1.25 kg ai/ha), oxyfluorfen 4% EC @ 6 kg/ha (0.15 kg ai/ha), pendimethalin 30% EC @ 4.5 kg/ha (1.50 kg ai/ha), pretilachlor 50% EC @ 3.75 kg/ha (0.75 kg ai/ha) on the same day of seeding or within six days of seeding. Recommendations for Karnataka Take up hand weeding at 20 and 40 days after transplanting and at 20 and 40 days after sowing in transplanted and drill sown Paddy respectively. Herbicide Quantity (ha) Time of application Remarks Transplanted Paddy - 2, 4- D Sodium salt 80 % 2.5 kg 3 - 4 weeks after transplanting We can control dicotyledonous weeds and annual grasses. Propanil 35 EC 7.5 lit weeds are at 1 or 2 leaf stage We can control both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds. Butachlor 5 % G 30 kg Broadcast the granules at 5 - 7 days after transplanting - 2,4 - D ethyl ester 5 % G 15 kg Spray 5 - 7 days after transplanting - Anilogard 1.5 lit --do-- - Thiobencarb 50 EC 4.0 lit Within 5 days after transplanting - Pendimethalin 30 EC 3.3 lit Within 3 - 5 days after transplanting - Oxidiazon 25 EC 1.0 lit Within 3 - 5 days after transplanting - Drill sown paddy Propanil 35 EC 7.5 lit Spray on weeds at 4 weeks after sowing We can control both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds. Butachlor 50 EC 3.0 lit Within 5 days after sowing - Pendimethalin 30 EC 3.3 lit Within 5 days after sowing Controls weeds belongs to Graminae family Biological weed control Use of living organisms viz., insects, disease organisms, herbivorous fish, snails or even competitive plants for the control of weeds is called biological control. In biological control method, it is not possible to eradicate weeds but weed population can be reduced. Hirschmanniella spinicaudata is a rice root nematode which controls most upland rice weed. Bactra verutana - a moth destroys Cyperus rotundus. Ludiwigia parviflora is completely destroyed by Altica cynanea (steel blue beetle) Top Integrated Weed Management Integrated weed management (IWM) involves the concept of multiple tactics of weed management, maintenance of weed population below economic injury level and conservation of environment quality. A successful IWM strategy has the principles of enhancing farmerâs profitability, environmental protection and responsiveness to consumer preference. Major components of IWM are Monitoring weeds, shift in weed flora, appearance of resistant weeds and introduction of new weeds. Emphasis on ecological, biological and biotechnological methods for environmental safety. Low cost agronomic technology for weed management in IWM system: >> Stale seedbed >> Balanced fertilizer use >> Higher plant population >> Intercropping / relay cropping >> Use of competitive cultivars >> Supplemental herbicide use at minimum possible rate. Wet seeded rice Pre-emergence application of Pretilachlor 0.75 kg/ha or Butachlor 1.0 kg/ha on 8 DAS or Pretilachlor + safener (Soft) at 0.45 kg/ha on 3-4 DAS followed by one hand weeding on 40 DAS. Alternatively post-emergence application of Almix 4g/ha + 0.2 % surfactant at 20 DAS followed by one hand weeding on 40 DAS. Rainfed rice Apply pendimethalin 1.0kg/ha on 5 days after sowing or Pretilachlor + safener (Sofit) 0.45kg/ha on the day of receipt of soaking rain followed by one hand weeding on 30 to 35 days after sowing. Top Special Practices for Kerala In certain areas like Kuttanad, wild rice has become a menace in recent years. The following agronomic practices can successfully control the infestation of wild rice. Coat dry seeds with 20% calcium peroxide using 4% PVA solution as an adhesive and then broadcast in the field with 10-15 cm column of standing water. Maintain the water level for 10-12 days to prevent germination of wild rice. Drain the field and apply N and K fertilizer as per recommendation for rapid growth of the rice seedlings. Control of Salvinia molesta (African payal) Trampling salvinia in situ in the wet lands a week before transplanting will control the weed and add to soil fertility. For chemical control of salvinia, spray paraquat 42% TP @ 3.15 kg/ha (0.75 kg ai/ha). Top Copyright Â© TNAU | All Rights Reserved
Cultivation Practices HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Sub Topics Cropping system in Tamil Nadu Cropping system in Karnataka Cropping system in Kerala Cropping System Cropping pattern is the yearly sequence and spatial arrangement of crops and fallow on a given area. Cropping system comprises all cropping patterns grown on the farm and their interaction with farm resources, other household enterprises and the physical, biological, technological and sociological factors or environments". Sequential cropping A form of multiple cropping in which paddy is grown in sequence on the same field, with the succeeding crop planted after the harvest of the preceding crop. Mixed cropping Growing of two or more varieties of paddy simultaneously and intermingled without row arrangements, where there is significant amount of intercrop competition. Mono-cropping system A system of cultivation in which a paddy is grown over a large area of land often for several years. Ratooning One of the important methods of intensive cropping, allowing the stubbles of paddy crop to strike again after harvesting and to raise another crop. Relay planting The second crop is planted into an established stand of a main crop. The second crop develops fully after the main crop is harvested. Top Rice Cropping System in Tamil Nadu Sequential cropping system In certain areas like Kuttanad, wild rice has become a menace in recent years. The following agronomic practices can successfully control the infestation of wild rice. Command areas: Rice (Aug.-Jan) â pulses/sesame/maize (Jan.-April) Rice (June-Sep.) - rice (Oct.-Jan.) - pulses / gingelly/green manure (Feb.-May) Rice (June-Sep.) - rice (Dec.-March) Rice (June-Sep.) - green manure (Oct.-Nov.) - rice (Dec.-March) Rice (Aug.-Jan.) - cotton (Feb.-June) Rice (Oct.-Jan.) - pearl millet/vegetables/sesame/ pulses/groundnut (Feb.-May) Rice (April-Aug.) - rice (Sep.-March) â fallow Well irrigated areas (Filter point well) Rice (Aug.-Jan.) - rice (Jan.-April.) - groundnut (April-June) Rice (Aug.-Nov.)-rice (Dec.-March) - rice(Mar-July) Rice/vegetables/marigold (June-Oct.) - maize (Oct.-Jan.) - pulses (Feb.-May) Rice (April-Aug.) - groundnut (Sep.-Dec.) - vegetables / gingelly (Jan.-March) Rice (Aug.-Jan.) - groundnut (Feb.-April) - sesame/ pulses/maize (April - June) Rice (Aug.-Jan.) - cotton (Feb.-June)/gingelly (Feb.- May) Rice (June-Oct.) - ragi / groundnut / gingelly (Nov.- Feb.)

Rainfed areas Upland rice/millets / pulses / groundnut / cotton / chillies (Sep.-Feb.) Dry rice (June-Aug.) - pulses / vegetables / gingelly (Sept.-Jan.) Rice (July-Nov.) Mixed varietal cropping system Coat dry seeds with 20% calcium peroxide using 4% PVA solution as an adhesive and then broadcast in the field with 10-15 cm column of standing water. Maintain the water level for 10-12 days to prevent germination of wild rice. Drain the field and apply N and K fertilizer as per recommendation for rapid growth of the rice seedlings. Control of Salvinia molesta (African payal) Growing of a mixture of autumn and winter varieties of rice in 3:1 ratio in Tamil Nadu (known as udo) is very much in practice. This system has a built-in advantage of low cost of cultivation as it eliminates of cost of land preparation for planting winter crop. However, under normal conditions it has created problems in performing agricultural operations like harvesting, deciding fertilizer doses etc. Top Rice Cropping System in Karnataka Mono-cropping system Tungabhadra project area of Karnataka is dominated by rice-rice mono-cropping system Sequential cropping system Rice -based cropping systems in the southern transitional zone of Karnataka are as follows: Rice-rice Rice-groundnut Rice-pulses Rice-fallow Rice-vegetables Rice-maize Ratoon cropping Rice ratoon cropping system offer considerable potential for increasing rice production and utilizing seasonally idle land and labour as well as residual moisture in the hilly region of Karnataka. The ratoon crop yield ranged from 76 to 350 % of the main crop yields. The ratoon crop had 24% shorter growth duration and 59 % higher mean yield than the main crop. Ratooning in Malnad region Inton and I.E.T - 7191 varieties are suitable for ratooning. Go for ratooning only good main crop was harvested. Harvest the crop 8-10 cm above ground level and after harvesting leave the land 8-10 days for drying Take up planking (hodta) 15 days after irrigation. At this stage top dress 50 kg Nitrogen through any source. Take up plant protection measures similar to that of main crop. Ratoon crop will be ready for harvest at 135 days. We can obtain 25 q yield per hectare. Top Rice Cropping System in Kerala Sequential cropping system General region Rice Rice Fallow Rice Rice Vegetable / pulses / oil seeds / green manure Kuttanad Water fallow Water fallow Rice Rice Rice Water fallow Onattukara Rice Rice Oil seed / green manure Kole / Kaippad Water fallow Rice Water fallow Water fallow Rice Rice Water fallow Water fallow Rice Pokkali Rice Fish / prawn --- High ranges Rice Rice Fallow Intercropping system : Cowpea may be raised as an intercrop in dry seeded low land (semi-dry) rice by sowing 12.5 kg seed/ha along with rice to serve as a source of green manure. When the rice field gets submerged with the onset of southwest monsoon, cowpea at the age of about six weeks and at active vegetative stage decays and gets self-incorporated in the soil adding substantial quantity of green manure. Such a system of concurrent growing of cowpea also reduces weed pressure in semi-dry rice. Mixed varietal cropping system Growing of a mixture of autumn and winter varieties of rice in 3:1 ratio in Kerala (called as koottumundkan) is very much in practice. This system has a built-in advantage of low cost of cultivation as it eliminates of cost of land preparation for planting winter crop. However, under normal conditions it has created problems in performing agricultural operations like harvesting, deciding fertilizer doses etc. RelayCropping Relay Cropping was done where seeds of pulses singly or in mixtures were broadcasted in standing paddy field 21 days before the harvesting of rice, after draining out of standing water. After the harvesting of main paddy crop, the seeds broadcasted in the standing paddy crop continues to grow till the harvesting by utilizing residual moisture and residual nutrients .The seed of succeeding crops like lentil, gram, pea, etc. is sown broadcast in maturing rice crop. This practice saves time; money (to be spent on land preparation etc.) utilizes residual fertility. This practice is common in both upland and lowland rice culture.

FAQs HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US General Season and Climate Varieties Rice Ecosystem SRI Nursery Management Cultivation Practices Nutrient Management Irrigation Pest and Diseases Frequently Asked Questions General What is Kisan call centre? The objective of scheme has been to make Agriculture knowledge available at free of cost to the farmers as and when desired. Kisan call centre No. is 1551 What are the Agril Implements developed from CRRI? There are several Agricultural implements developed by CRRI viz. Mini parboiling Unit, Star cum Cono weeder, CRRI multicrop seed drill (2 rows). Drum seeder, 3 row manual pull type seed drill, paddy wheel hoe. Two row rice seed cum fertilizer drill, Rice husk; Chaff stove, finger weeder, 4 row manual rice transplanter, hand shovel, hand plough. Who will provide knowledge in I.P.M.? Agricultural University and Agricultural department. What does the rice grain look like? It looks like a smooth glistening ovoid particle, emerald green in color (during ripening stage, however, it turns golden yellow). After it is milled, the kernel will appear shiny white in color. Where and when did rice originate? The origins of rice have been debated for some time, but the plant is of such antiquity that the precise time and place of its first development will perhaps never be known. It is certain, however, that the domestication of rice ranks as one of the most important developments in history, for rice is the longest, continuously grown cereal crop in the world. Botanical and linguistic evidence point to the early origin of domesticated rice along a broad arc from eastern India through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, northern Vietnam,and into southern China. The earliest and most convincing evidence for domestication of rice in Southeast Asia was discovered in 1966 at Non Nok Tha in the Korat area of Thailand. These remains have been confirmed as dating from at least 4000 B.C. What is rice bran? The tan nutrient-rich outer layer covering a rice kernel. Rice bran has a sweet nutty flavor and is an excellent source of nutrients, minerals, and fiber. What are the two types of starch found in rice? Amylose and amylopectin. Amylose makes the rice separate and fluffy. Amylopectin, the waxy starch, gives rice a sticky consistency when cooked. Where does rice grow? Rice grows in the upland area, irrigated area, rainfed lowland area, and the flood-prone area. Rice is highly adaptable and can be grown even in diverse environments. What is a paddy? A paddy is a field that is flooded with water. Rough rice is also called paddy rice. What are the main components of the rice grain? The rice grain, commonly called a seed, consists of the true fruit or brown rice (caryopsis) and the hull, which encloses the brown rice. Brown rice consists mainly of the embryo and endosperm. The surface of the seed contains several thin layers of differentiated tissues that enclose the embryo and endosperm. What are the parts of a hull? The hull is composed of two modified leaves, the palea and lemma. They are held together by hook like structures. The cells of the mature hull are highly lignified and brittle, with high concentration of silica. What do you refer to as the embryo of the rice grain? The embryo or germ is extremely small and is located on the ventral side of the caryopsis. It contains the embryonic leaves (plumule) and embryonic root (radical), which are joined by a very short stem (mesocotyl). The plumule is enclosed by a cylinder like protective covering, the coleoptiles, and the radical is ensheathed by a mass of soft tissue, the coleorhizae. The outer side of the embryo is enclosed by the aleurone layer. What is the endosperm? Consisting of the aleurone layer and the starchy endosperm, it serves as food for the germinating embryo. What consists the vegetative organ of the rice plants? The vegetative organs consist of roots, culms (stems), and leaves. What is a panicle? The panicle is the terminal shoot of a rice plant that produces grain. What is a spikelet? A spikelet is a unit of the panicle, and consists of two sterile lemmas, the rachilla, and the floret (flower). Since rice has only one fully developed floret per spikelet, these terms are often used interchangeably. What is a tiller? A tiller is any of the extra stems or culms in a rice plant that arise from its base. Varieties that have genetic capacity to put out many stems are referred to as "heavy-tillering" varieties. What is a ligule? It is a small, papery, triangular structure at the base of the leaf blade of the rice plant. How can you distinguish a male from a female rice plant? Rice is naturally a self-pollinating plant. It is self-fertilizing, that is, it has both male and female organs. To cross two varieties, you must normally remove the male parts from one variety and then fertilize it with pollen from the other. How do we get the grains from the rice plant? In some countries, rice plants are harvested by a machine called a combine harvester. Most harvesting, however, is done by hand, using a knife or a sickle. Then the grain has to be separated from the straw in a process called threshing. The rice we eat is always white but on the rice plant, and when drying on the road, it is golden in color. How do the grains change color from golden to white? After the moisture content of the rice has been reduced due to sun drying, the milling process begins. A Sheller removes the inedible hull from the rice. The bran is then removed from the brown rice by abrasion as the grains are forced to rub against one another. How long will it take to produce one variety of rice? By conventional breeding method, it will take 5 to 10 years to develop one variety of rice but with biotechnology as a tool, an outstanding variety can be developed within 1 to 2 years. How long does it take to produce a rice crop, from beginning to end? The duration depends upon the maturity of the rice being produced. It takes about 90 to 200 days for a rice crop to mature. Top Season and Climate Does climate affect rice yields? Temperature, solar radiation, and rainfall influence rice yield by directly affecting the physiological processes involved in grain production, and indirectly through diseases and insects. What is the effect of global climate change to rice production? A warming of 2Â°C promotes sterility in rice, reducing the yield 25% or more. Consequently, the effect of low temperature to rice production is that the growth duration of rice will be prolonged. What will be the effect of low temperatures during the ripening stage of the rice plant? Rice grains shatter easily from the panicle and grain dormancy is shorter when the temperatures during ripening are low. The rice plant produces more straw than grains. What will be the effect of high temperatures during the ripening stage of the rice plant? High temperatures accelerate grain ripening, resulting in prematurity. Prematurity may result in partially chalky and milk-white kernels and thicker bran and aleurone layers. Top Varieties How many varieties have been developed from CRRI Seventy varieties have been developed from C.R.R.I Is there any hybrid varieties of CRRI, their duration and yield? There are two hybrid varieties Ajay and Rajlaxmi. Duration is 135 days for both having yield potential of 7.5 t/ha and 7.0 t/ha respectively. Is there any Aromatic varieties of CRRI, their duration and yield? There are two Aromatic varieties of CRRI vig. Geetanjali and Ketekijoha. Duration is 135 days and 145 days with yield potential of 5.0 t/ha and 4.0 t/ha respectively. How many different kinds of rice are there? There are about 120,000 varieties known to exist. What is rough rice? Rough rice, or paddy rice, is a rice that has been harvested and threshed but still has its hull and bran. I have heard about japonica rice. What is it? The japonica varieties have narrow dark green leaves, medium-height tillers, and short to intermediate plant height. It is usually grown in cooler subtropics and temperate climates, such as Japan, Portugal, Spain, USSR, Italy, and France. What is indica rice? The traditional indica rice varieties, widely grown throughout the tropics and subtropics, are tall and heavy tillering with long, narrow, light green leaves. What is javanica rice? Javanica rice belong to the japonica race of O. sativa, and thus are morphologically similar to japonicas. However, javanicas have wider and more pubescent (hairy) leaves. In addition, the grain frequently has hairlike awns. Varieties belonging to javanicas are grown only in Indonesia, in the rice terraces of the Philippines, and in the mountainous areas of Madagascar. What is an accession? An accession is a variety, a strain, or a bulk population registered at the national center and worth conserving. Top Rice Ecosystem Which varieties of paddy are more suitable under rainfed uplands? High yielding varieties maturing within 110 days like Heera, Sneha, Pathara, Bandana, Kalinga III,Parijat, Arnapurna, Ghanteswari, Khandagiri, Nilagiri etc. to be direct sown in lines. Which varieties of paddy are more suitable for rainfed medium land? High yielding paddy varieties maturing within 135 days like Lalat, MTU-1001, Sworna etc. Which varieties of paddy are more suitable for rainfed low lands? High yielding paddy varieties maturing within 150 days like Moti, Kanchana, Gouri, Padmini, Bhaja, Samanta, Meher. Describe the upland area and its rice Many of the world's poorest farmers live in the uplands. Their farming systems are highly diverse, with tree products and livestock often making important contributions to family income. Most farmers still grow traditional varieties without using chemical inputs. More than 17 million hectares of upland rice are grown worldwide -- around 60% of them are in Asia. What about the rainfed lowland rice and its environment? The rainfed lowland ecosystem covers 37 million hectares or about one-fourth of the world's total rice area. Rainfed-lowlands are heterogeneous in any single location, diverse across locations, and unpredictable everywhere. Hundreds of the world's poorest people depend on them for their livelihood. Top System of Rice Intensification (SRI) Which is the most suited season for SRI? Dry season with assured irrigation is more suitable. In which areas we should avoid SRI? Difficulty in crop establishment may be seen in areas with heavy downpour (NE Monsoon periods of Tamil Nadu) What type of varieties used for SRI? Hybrids and varieties with heavy tillering. What is the seed rate? 7-8 kg for single seedling per hill. What is the nursery area to plant in 1 ha? Prepare 100 m2 nurseries to plant 1 ha. How much soil mixture is needed for 100 m2 nursery? Four (4) m3 of soil mixture is needed for 100 m2 nursery. How to prepare shallow raised beds? Spread a plastic sheet or used polythene gunny bags on the shallow raised bed to prevent roots growing deep into soil. What are the components of soil mixture of nursery raised beds? What is the proportion of soil mixture components? Mix 70 % soil + 20 % well â decomposed pressmud / bio â gas slurry / FYM + 10 % rice hull. Incorporate in the soil mixture 1.5 kg of powdered di â ammonium phosphate or 2kg 17 â 17 â 17 NPK fertilizer. How to prepare shallow raised beds? Filling in soil mixtures: Place a wooden frame of 0.5 m long, 1 m wide and 4 m deep divided into 4 equal segments on the plastic sheet or banana leaves. Fill the frame almost to the top with the soil moisture. How can we make the seed to germinate before sowing? Is pre - germination is needed before sowing? Pre â germinating the seeds 2 days before sowing : Soak the seeds for 24 h, drain and incubate the soaked seeds for 24 h, sow when the seeds sprout and radical (seed root) grows to 2-3 mm long. How much pre â germinated seeds required / m2 ? How to sow the seeds in raised beds? Sow the pre â germinated seeds weighing 90 â 100 g / m2 (100 g dry seed may weigh 130 g after sprouting) uniformly and cover them with dry soil to a thickness of 5 mm. Sprinkle water immediately using rose can to soak the bed and remove the wooden frame and continue the process until the required area is completed. How to maintain the nursery beds? Water the nursery with rose can as and when needed (twice or thrice a day) to keep the soil moist. Protect the nursery from heavy rains for the first 5 DAS. At 6 DAS, maintain thin film of water all around the seedling mats. Drain the water 2 days before removing the seedlings mats for transplanting. Is there any extra cares needed in nursery? If seedling growth is slow, sprinkle 0.5% urea + 0.5% zinc sulphate solution at 8-10 DAS. What is the duration of nursery period? Seedlings reach sufficient height for planting at 15 days. Lift the seedling mats and transport them to main field. How to prepare the main field for SRI? Plough the land during summer to economize the water requirement for initial preparation of land. Flood the field 1 or 2 days before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface of the field covered with water. Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling. What are the techniques to tackle the problem soil? For fluffy paddy soils: Compact the soil by passing 400 g stone roller or oil â drum with stones inside, eight times at proper moisture level (moisture level at friable condition of soil which is approximately 13 to 18%) once in three years, to prevent the sinking of draught animals and workers during puddling.

The production of foundation seed stage I and II shall be supervised and approved by the certification agency and be so handled as to maintain specific genetic identity and genetic purity and shall be required to confirm to certification standards specified for the crop / variety being certified. What is meant by certified seeds? Certified seed shall be the progeny of foundation seed and its production shall be so handled as to maintain specific genetic identity and purity according to the standards prescribed for the crop being certified. Certified seed may be the progeny of certified seed provided this reproduction does not exceed three generations beyond foundation seed stage-I. What is hybrid seed? The first generation resulting from crossing of two varieties or parents. Hybrid(certified) seed is the first generation resulting from the cross of two approved inbred lines or parents , one of which is male sterile. What is Labelled Seed? The seed notified under Section 5 of the Seeds Act, 1966. Such seed sold in the market has to be labelled as prescribed under Section 6(a) and (b) of the Seeds Act. Such seed is called Labelled Seed. Which are the agencies that can produce certified seeds? Anybody willing to come forward to produce certified seed can produce certified seed. At present State Seeds Corporations, National Seeds Corporation, State Farm Corporation of India, State Departments of Agriculture, Private Companies, Cooperatives and individual farmers are producing certified seed.

What are the methods of growing rice? Transplanting and direct seeding. What is transplanting rice? In transplanting rice, seedlings are first grown in seedbeds before they are transplanted in the fields. What are the three growth phases of the rice plant? Vegetative, reproductive, and ripening. How do you characterize the vegetative stage? It is characterized by active tillering (when shoots arise from the main culm or stem), gradual increase in plant height, and leaf emergence at regular intervals. How do you characterize the reproductive growth stage? It is characterized by culm elongation (which increases plant height), decline in tiller number, emergence of the flag leaf (the last leaf), booting, heading, and flowerings. How do you characterize the ripening stage? It is characterized by leaf senescence and grain growth. In the reproductive growth stage, what do you refer to as the booting? During the latter part of the panicle development stage (about 16 days after visual panicle initiation), the sheath of the flag leaf swells. This swelling of the flag leaf sheath is called booting. What about the heading stage? It is the emergence of the panicle out of the flag leaf sheath. What about flowering? The flowering stage occurs when the anthers of the terminal spikelets protrude and shed pollen. It occurs 25 days after visual panicle initiation regardless of the variety. Ripening involves three stages; what are these? These are the milky grain stage, the dough grain stage, the yellow-ripe grain stage, and the mature grain stage. How do you describe the milky grain stage? The contents of the caryopsis (the starch portion of the grain) are first watery but later turn milky in consistency. When held upright, the top of the panicle during milk stage will bend gently in an arc. The content of the grain is a white liquid that can be squeezed out. What about the dough grain stage? It is when the milky portion of the grain turns first into soft and later hard dough. And what about the mature grain stage? The grain color in the panicles begins to change from green to yellow. The individual grain is mature, fully developed, and is hard and free from green tint. The mature grain stage is complete when 90-100% of the filled spikelets have turned yellow. The panicle arches further with the exception of a few still green spikelets and all grains are yellow and hard. What about weed management? Just as with insect pests of rice, a mixture of approaches for weed management needs to be applied. For more than 2,000 years, water and the physical removal of weeds have been the dominant components of weed management. To date, herbicide application is the solution. But other approaches needs to be developed. Good land management with level fields can be combined with minimum water use for effective weed control, use of clean seeds can prevent new weed species from being introduced; and mechanization of planting, both for transplanting and for direct seeding, allows for easier weed management. Long- term solutions to weed management will include developing rice cultivars that outcompete weeds for resources (light, nutrients, and water) and that interfere with weed growth. Weeds have their own pests: insects, diseases, and nematodes. Opportunities exist to use these indigenous natural control agents as biological weed management tools. Why do some farmers prefer transplanting rather than direct seeding? So the rice will have a head start over the weeds. This will minimize the cost of weeding and expensive chemicals. Top Nutrient Management What will be recommended fertilizer dose for rainfed upland, Kharif and Rabi rice. Fertilizer dose for unfavourable rainfed upland NPK will be @ 40-20-20 kg/ha Lowland Kharif irrigated rice 60-30-30 kg/ha Rabi rice 80-40-40 kg/ha What will be recommended fertilizer dose for Hybrid rice and Aromatic rice? Fertilizer dose for Hybrid rice N, P & K 100-60-60 kg/ha Aromatic rice N,P,K ,Zn 60-30-30-25 kg/ha How fertilizer management can be done in nursery bed? Fertilizer dose for 10 decimal areas is as follows. For 10 decimal nursery area, it is recommended to use 2 quintal of FYM, 4.5 kg of Urea, 13 kg of SSP and 3.5 kg of MOP. If required 4.5 kg Urea may be applied as top dressing after 15 days of sowing. What is Azolla? How Azolla can be beneficial to us? Azolla is a water fern. It fixes atmospheric nitrogen into the soil with the help of blue green algae by symbiosis process. Its application improves soil health and soil fertility. Azolla suppresses weed growth, reduces loss of applied chemical Nitrogen fertilizer. Azolla Biofertilizers technology is simple, economic and ecofriendly. In rice field Azolla grown once before or after planting can produce upto 25 tons of fresh biomass and contribute upto 50 kg N/ha. Azolla grown once during the cropping season can easily supply 20-40 kg N/ha. Azolla can be used as a feed for poultry, duckery, fish and cattle. Which is the cheapest source of nitrogenous fertilizer? Urea fertilizer is the cheapest among all types. In acid soils which type of phosphate fertilizer is helpful? Rock phosphate should be applied one month before sowing or 50% Rock phosphate + 50% single super phosphate. At which time phosphate fertilizer will be applied? Only basal application at the time of final ploughing. What are the types of Biofertilizers and for which crop these can be applied Type of Biofertilizers: Azotobactor for all non-paddy crops. Azospirillum for wet land paddy crop. Rhizobium for pulses and Groundnut. P.S.M. for all crops. Potash solublising micro-organism for all crops. How the soil health can be maintained? By application of organic manure and recycling of crops residues. What is fertilizer dose of high yielding paddy? 24:12:12 kgs of NPK per acre for short duration. 32:16:16 kgs of NPK per acre for medium and late duration high yielding paddy. How the nitrogen fertilizer will be applied in paddy crop? 25% at the time of sowing/transplanting 50% at the time of beausaning/Tilling. 25% at panicle initiation stage. In fertilizer application, what does topdressing mean? Topdressing means applying fertilizer to the soil or water surface after seeding or transplanting or after the crop has been well established (usually at the panicle initiation stage about 3 weeks after flowering). Top Irrigation What are the critical growth stage for water requirement of paddy? Rice: Seedling stage. Maximum tilling stage Panicle initiation stage Flowering Stage Soft dough or milky stage. Describe irrigated rice Irrigated rice is grown in bunded, puddled fields with an assured water supply for one or more crops a year. Worldwide, 80 million hectares of irrigated rice (55% of the total area) produce about three quarters of all rice harvested. Average yields vary from 3 to 9 tons per hectare. Describe flood-prone rice and its environment Farmers in South and Southeast Asia grow approximately 10 million hectares of flood-prone rice, which account for nearly 88% of all such rice grown in the world. There are three major kinds of flood-prone rice: deepwater, which tolerates water depths of 50-l00 centimeters; floating, which can be found in water up to 400 centimeters deep; and tidal wetland, which can survive submergence, sometimes in salty water, for short periods.

The C O D E X A L I M E N T A R I U S international food standards, guidelines and codes of practice contribute to the safety, quality and fairness of this international food trade. Consumers can trust the safety and quality of the food products they buy and importers can trust that the food they ordered will be in accordance with their specifications. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, established by FAO and WHO in 1963 develops harmonised international food standards, guidelines and codes of practice to protect the health of the consumers and ensure fair trade practices in the food trade. The Commission also promotes coordination of all food standards work undertaken by international governmental and non-governmental organizations. Codex standards are based on the best available science assisted by independent international risk assessment bodies or ad-hoc consultations organized by FAO and WHO. While being recommendations for voluntary application by members, Codex standards serve in many cases as a basis for national legislation. Codex process - in many cases assisted by the Codex Trust Fund, which strives to finance - and train - participants from such countries to enable efficient participation. Being an active member of Codex helps countries to compete in sophisticated world markets - and to improve food safety for their own population. At the same time exporters know what importers demand, and importers are protected from substandard shipments. International governmental and non-governmental organizations can become accredited Codex observers to provide expert information, advice and assistance to the Commission.

Nursery Management HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Types and Preparation Seed Rate, Quality Treatment Management strategies Nursery Management Types and Preparation 1. Wet nursery 2. Dapog or Mat Nursery 3. Dry nursery Wet Nursery Nursery area Select 20 cents (800 m2) of land area near to water source for transplanting one hectare in conventional method. Required nursery area for SRI is 100 m2 / ha (or) 2.5 cent / ha (or) 1cent / acre Nursery bed preparation The area should have an assured water supply and an efficient drainage system. It should be dry ploughed twice and apply 1tonne of FYM or compost to 20cents nursery. Later, it should be irrigated and allowed to be wet for another two days. Afterwards it should be puddled twice and the puddling may be repeated after a gap of one week. Basal application of DAP 40kg is recommended when the seedlings are to be pulled out in 20-25 days after sowing in less fertile nursery soils, and if not readily available, apply straight fertilizers 16kg of urea and 120kg of super phosphate. After levelling and final puddling, beds of convenient length (8-10 m) with width of 2.5 m are to be made, leaving 30 - 50 cm channels in between two beds. Sow the sprouted seeds uniformly on the seedbed. Top Dapog / Mat Nursery In Mat nursery seedlings are established in a layer of soil mix, arranged on a firm surface (Concrete floor/ polythene sheet/ seedling trays). Seedlings are ready for planting within 14-20 days after seeding (DAS). Nursery area Required nursery area is 100 m2 / ha (or) 2.5 cent / ha â 1cent / acre Nursery bed preparation Select a level area near the water source with efficient drainage system. The surface should be covered with banana leaves with the mid-rib removed or polyethylene sheets or any flexible material or cemented floors to prevent seedling roots from penetrating to the bottom soil layer. a. Preparation of soil mixture Four (4) m3 of soil mix is needed for each 100 m2 of nursery. Mix 70% soil + 20% well-decomposed pressmud / bio-gas slurry / FYM + 10% rice hull. Incorporate 1.5kg of powdered di-ammonium phosphate or 2kg 17-17-17 NPK fertilizer with the soil mixture. b. Filling the soil mixture Place a wooden frame of 0.5 m long, 1 m wide and 4 cm deep divided into 4 equal segments on the plastic sheet or banana leaves, fill the frame almost to the top with the soil mixture. c. Pre-germinating the seeds Soak the seeds for 24 hrs, drain and incubate the soaked seeds for 24 hrs, sow when the seeds sprout and radicle (seed root) grows to 2-3 mm long and cover them with dry soil to a thickness of 5mm. Top Dry Nursery Nursery area Area : 20cents This type of nursery is handy in times of delayed receipt of canal water or areas where sufficient water is not available. Nursery bed preparation The field is dry ploughed 5-6 times to acquire the fine tilth. Nursery area with sand and loamy soil status is more suitable for this type of nursery. Plots of 1 to 1.5 m bed width and channels may be formed. Length may be according to the slope and soil. After preparing the beds they are to be wetted and 1 tonne of FYM, 2.5 kg of P2O5 and 2 kg of potash need to be applied. Sowing may be dry seeding. Seeds may be covered with sand and finely powdered farm yard manure. Top Seed Rate, Quality and Treatment Seed Rate SRI method - 7-8 kg/ha (for all varieties and hybrids) Conventional method 30 kg for long duration varieties 40 kg for medium duration varieties 60 kg for short duration varieties 20 kg for Hybrids Top Seed Quality Healthy and vigorous seedlings are the bases for better crop growth and yield. Vigorous seedlings produced in the nursery will be able to withstand pest attack in the main field. Seeds intended for sowing should satisfy the following requirements : The seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown. The seed should be clean and free from mixtures of other seeds. The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in size. The seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage The seed should have a high germinating capacity. Before sowing, the seed should be treated with fungicides which protects the seed against soil-born fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings. Upgradation of seed quality using salt solution Ten litre of water is taken in a plastic bucket of 15 litre capacity and a good quality fresh egg is dropped in the water and the egg sinks in water and reaches the bottom. The commercial grade common salt is added little by little and dissolved in water. As the density of salt solution increases, the egg raise up. The addition of salt (Sodium chloride) is stopped when the surface of the egg is visible above the solution. To this salt solution add 10kg of seeds. The seeds with low density float on the surface of the solution. The seeds floating on the surface of the solution are removed. The seeds sunk in the solution are washed for 2-3 times in water and then used. Top Seed Treatment Types Wet seed treatment Dry seed treatment Wet seed treatment : Treat the seeds in Carbendazim or Pyroquilon or Tricyclozole solution at 2 gm/lit of water for 1 kg of seeds for 10 hrs and drain excess water. This wet seed treatment gives protection to the seedlings up to 40 days from seedling disease such as blast. If the seeds are required for sowing immediately, keep the soaked seed in gunny bag in dark room for 24hrs for sprouting. Seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens: Treat the seeds with Pseudomonas fluorescens 10gm/kg and soak in 1 lit of water overnight. Decant the excess water and allow the seeds to sprout for 24 hrs and then sow. Seed treatment with Azospirillum: Three packets (600 g/ha) of Azospirillum and 3 packets (600g/ha) of Phosphobacteria or 6 packets (1200g/ha) of Azophophirillum bioinoculants mixed with sufficient water. Biocontrol agents are compatible with biofertilizers, so it can be mixed together for seed soaking. Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible. Dry seed treatment : Seed treatment with Fungicide: Mix the seeds with Captan or Thiram 24 hrs before sowing @ 4g/kg of seed. This dry seed treatment gives protection to the seedlings up to 40 days from seedling disease such as blast. Top Management strategies Nursery Management Timetable Top Days Operations 3-5 Weed management (if needed) 10-20 Pest / disease management practices 15 Apply DAP 40 kg, if DAP is not applied as basal dose 25-35 Pulling out the seedlings. Short duration (25 days). Medium duration (30 days). Long duration (35 days). SRI (14 Days). * Apply 20 kg gypsum a day before pulling out of seedling if soil is heavy clay Water Mangement Wet Method Drain the water 18 to 24hrs after sowing Allow enough water to saturate the soil from 3rd to 5th day. From 5th day onwards, increase the water depth to 1.5cm depending on the height of the seedlings. Thereafter maintain 2.5cm depth of water. Mat Nursery Method Water the nursery with rose can as and when needed (twice or thrice a day) to keep the soil moist. At 6 DAS, maintain thin film of water all round the seedling mats. Dry method Irrigation may be done to wet the soil to saturation. Top Nutrient Management Wet method If seedlings are to be pulled out after 25 days, application of DAP is to be done 10 days prior to pulling. 4kg of gypsum and 1kg of DAP per cent can be applied for clay soil on 10th day after sowing. Mat nursery method Though the temperature and water are adequate, the seedlings show yellowing (N deficiency). Sprinkle seedlings with 0.5% urea (1.5 kg Urea in 300 l water/100 m2). Top Weed Management Apply pre-emergence herbicides viz., Pretilachlor + safener @ 0.3kg/ha, on 3rd or 4th day after sowing to control weeds in the lowland nursery. Grown up weeds may be removed by manually. Top Pest Management Nursery pest : 1. Army worm (Spodoptera mauritia) 2. Thrips (Stenchaetothrips biformis) 3. Green leafhopper (Nephotettix nigropictus, N. cincticeps, N. virescens) 4. Caseworm (Nymphula depunctalis) Army worm (Spodoptera mauritia) Symptom of damage Larvae cut the seedlings in large scale Severe infestation - cattle grazing appearance to the field. They feed gregariously and march from field to field. Nature of damage Caterpillars march in large numbers in the evening hours and feed on the leaves of paddy seedlings till the morning and hide during daytime. They feed gregariously and after feeding the plants in one field march onto the next field. Under severe infestation crop gives the grazed appearance. Attacked plants are reduced to stumps. Nurseries situated in ill-drained marshy areas attacked earlier than dry ground. Damage is severe during July to September. Identification of insect pest Egg: Eggs are spherical and creamy in colour, which are laid in a group covered over with grey hairs. Larva: The caterpillars are light green with yellowish white lateral and dorsal stripes in the early stage and later become dark brown or grayish green in colour with a crescent (Semi-circular) shaped black spot on the side of each segment. Pupa: They pupate inside the soil in earthen cocoons. Pupa is dark brown and measures 16 -17mm long. Adult: The adult moth is medium sized, stout built dark brown with a conspicuous triangular black spot on the forewings. Hind wings are brownish white with thin black margins. Management strategies Cultural control Flood the nursery to expose the hiding larvae to the surface and thus they are picked up by birds. Apply kerosene to water to suffocate and kill the larvae. Allow the ducks into the field to feed the larvae. Chemical control: Drain the water from the nursery and spray chlorpyriphos 20 EC 80 ml Top Thrips (Stenchaetothrips biformis) Symptom of damage The crop is highly susceptible in the nursery stage for the first 23-25 days after transplanting/sowing. The tips of leaves get rolled longitudinally into needle like outgrowths and turn whitish. In severe cases, the lower leaves also turn yellowish. The infestation may be rated as mild, if there is less than three needle like leaves and as severe, if there are more than three outgrowths with the lower leaves also showing chlorosis and scorching. The infestation invariably disappears after sharp showers. Nature of damage: Both the adults and nymphs lacerate the tender leaves and suck up the plant sap. As a result fine yellowish lines or silvery streaks are seen on the leaves. Later, the leaves curl longitudinally and begin to dry from the tip downwards. In sever cases, the entire nursery may dry up and fail to produce seedling. Sometimes transplanted crop is also affected in the early stages. Life stages Egg: Eggs laid singly in the tissues of the tender leaves on the sides facing the stem. Eggs are hyaline and turn pale yellow as they mature. Nymph: Newly hatched nymphs are transparent but turn yellowish white after the first moult and possess darker legs, head and antennae. Pupa: Pupation takes place inside the rolled leaves and appendages and wings are clearly visible. Adult: Adult is 1mm long, dark brown to black in colour with fringed wings. Male is smaller, more slender than female. It reproduces partheno-genetically since males are seldom seen in the population. Management strategies Cultural control Submerge infested crops intermittently for 1-2 days. Drag a wet cloth on the seedlings. Chemical control Phosphamidon 40SL 50ml Biological control Predatory thrips, coccinellid beetles, anthocorid bugs, and staphylinid beetles are biological control agents that feed on both the larvae and adults. Top Green leafhopper (Nephotettix nigropictus, N. cincticeps, N. virescens) Symptom of damage Yellowing of leaves from tip to downwards. Vector for the diseases viz., Rice tungro virus, rice yellow & transitory yellowing. Nature of damage Both nymphs and adults suck the plant sap from the leaf and leaf sheath. Mild infestation reduces the vigour of the plant and the number of reproductive tillers. Heavy infestation causes withering and complete drying of the crop. Plants are predisposed to fungal and bacterial infection through feeding and ovipositional punctures. . It also transmits plant diseases such as dwarf, transitory yellowing, yellow dwarf and rice tungro virus (Tungro is transmitted during short feeding period). Life stages Egg: Greenish transparent eggs are deposited in the midrib of leaf blade or sheath of rice or green grass. They are laid in batches of 10 to 15 arranged in a single row. Nymph: The nymphs are soft bodied, yellow white in colour. Gradually the colour changes to green with five nymphal instars and become adults in 18-20 days. Adult: Adults are 3-5 mm long, bright green with variable black markings, wedge shaped with a characteristic diagonal movement. Male insect has a black spot in middle of the forewings that is absent in females. The insect is active during July to September. Longevity: Females live for 50-55 days. Management strategies : Cultural control Use resistant varieties like IR 50, CR 1009, Co 46, PTB 2 and PTB 18. Nursery should not be raised near the lamp posts. Apply neem cake @ 12.5 Kg/20 cent nursery as basal dose. Chemical control Spray anyone of the following herbicide: Carbofuran 3 G 3.5 kg (or) Phorate 10 G 1.0 kg (or) Quinalphos 5 G 2.0 kg Top Rice Caseworm (Case Worm, Nymphula depunctalis (Guen.), Pyraustidae, Lepidoptera)Symptom of damage Caterpillars feed on green tissues of the leaves and leave become whitish papery. Tubular cases around the tillers by cutting the apical portion of leaves. Floating of tubular cases on the water. Nature of damage The caterpillar cuts a piece of leaf roll it longitudinally into a tubular structure and remains inside. It feeds by scraping the green tissue of the leaf. The cases often float in the water. Identification of insect pest Egg: Eggs are light yellow, disc like, smooth and irregular in shape. They are laid on the underside of the leaves floating on the water. Larva: Pale translucent green with orange head. It has filamentous gills on the sides of the body that helps to lead a semi aquatic life Pupa: It pupates inside the leaf case. Fresh pupae are milky white, which gradually turn to light yellow. Adult: Moth is delicate white moth with pale brown wavy markings. The adult is a small delicate moth having white wings speckled with pale brown wavy markings. Females are larger than males. Egg laying takes place in the night. Management strategies Cultural control Mix 250 ml of kerosene to the standing water Dislodge the cases by passing a rope and drain water Collect the cases and destroy Chemical control Spray any one of the following herbicide : Quinalphos 25 EC 80 ml. Top Diseases Mangement Nursery Diseases : Blast - Pyricularia oryzea Brown spot - Drechslera oryzae (Cochliobolus miyabean) Rice Tungro virus disease (i)Rice tungro Bacilliform virus (ii) Rice tungro Spherical virus Rice blast (Pyricularia oryzea) Symptom of damage Disease can infect paddy at all growth stages and all aerial parts of plant (Leaf, neck and node). Small specks originate on leaves - subsequently enlarge into spindle shaped spots(0.5 to 1.5cm length, 0.3 to 0.5cm width) with ashy center. Several spots coalesce and form big irregular patches Management Strategies Avoid excess N - fertilizer application Use of tolerant varieties ( Palghuna, Swarnamukhi, Swathi, Prabhat, Co 47, IR - 64, IR - 36, Jaya) Dry seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens talc formulation @10g/kg of seed. Stagnate water to a depth of 2.5 cm in the nursery. Sprinkle 2.5 kg of P. fluorescens (talc) and mix with stagnated water. Soak the root system of seedlings for 30 min and transplant. Seed treatment at 2.0 g/kg seed with Captan or Carbendazim or Thiram or Tricyclazole. Spraying of Tricyclazole at 1g/lit of water or Edifenphos at 1 ml/lit of water or Carbendazim at 1.0 gm/lit. Top Brown Spot : Helminthosporium oryzae Also called as sesame leaf spot (or) Helminthosporiose (or ) fungal blight Symptoms Occur in nursery as well as main field Causes blight of seedlings Isolated brown, round to oval (resemble sesame seed) spots and coalesce to form large patches. 50% yield reduction in severe cases Management Use of tolerant varieties (Co 20, IR â 24 and Padma) and disease free seeds.

Spray Mancozeb (2.0g/lit) Top Rice Tungro virus disease (i)Rice tungro Bacilliform virus (ii) Rice tungro Spherical virus Vector : Green leaf hopper Symptoms Plants affected by tungro exhibit stunting and reduced tillering. Their leaves become yellow or orange-yellow, may also have rust-colored spots. Discoloration begins from leaf tip and extends down to the blade or the lower leaf portion Management Strategies Set up light traps to monitoring and attract vectors. Leaf yellowing can be minimized by spraying 2% urea mixed with Mancozeb at 2.5 gm/lit. Grow tolerant varieties are Co 45, Co 48, Surekha, Vikramarya, Bharani, IR 36. In nursery when virus infection is low, apply Carbofuran granules @ 1 kg a.i./ha to control vector population. Top Copyright Â© TNAU | All Rights Reserved
Nutrient Management HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Importance of Nutrients Nutritional Disorders Manuring Fertilizer Requirement INM Nutrient Management Importance of Nutrients Paddy requires the following essential nutrients for its normal development: Carbon Nitrogen Calcium Hydrogen Phosphorus Magnesium Oxygen Potassium Sulphur Iron Zinc Chlorine Manganese Boron Copper Molybdenum Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are known as primary plant nutrients; calcium, magnesium and sulphur, as secondary nutrients; iron manganese, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum and chlorine as trace elements or micro-nutrients. The primary and secondary nutrient elements are known as major elements. This classification is based on their relative abundance, and not on their relative importance. The micronutrients are required in small quantities, but they are important as the major elements in plant nutrition. Nitrogen Nitrogen, the most important nutrient for rice, is universally limiting the rice productivity. Nitrogen encourages the vegetative development of plants by imparting a healthy green color to the leaves. It seems that majority of Indica varieties are adapted to relatively low levels of nitrogen in the region of 25 kg N/ha. Rice plant depends mainly for its nitrogen upon the decomposition of organic matter under anaerobic conditions and in the early stages of growth takes up nitrogen in the form of ammonia which is the stable form of nitrogen in submerged soils. There are two stages in the growth of rice crop when nitrogen is most needed; early vegetative and panicle initiation stages. Fertilizing the crop during early vegetative growth promotes tillering leading to higher yield. Application at panicle initiation or early booting stage will help the plant produce more and heavier grains per panicle. Phosphorus Phosphorus is particularly important in early growth stages. It is mobile within the plant and promotes root development (Particularly the development of fibrous roots),tillering and early flowering. Addition of mineral P fertilizer is required when the rice plants root system is not yet fully developed and the native soil P supply is inadequate. Phosphorus is remobilized within the plant during later growth stages if sufficient P has been absorbed during early growth. It also increases resistance to disease and strengthens the stems of cereal plants, thus reducing their tendency to lodge. It offsets the harmful effects of excess nitrogen in the plant. Potassium Potassium enhances the ability of the plants to resist diseases, insect attacks, cold and other adverse conditions. It plays an essential part in the formation of starch and in the production and translocation of sugars, and is thus of special value to carbohydrate-rich crops. Involves in working of enzymes. Helps in production and movement of photosynthates to sink. Helps in proper uptake of other nutrients. Influences tillering or branching of plant and size and weight of grain. Over 80 per cent of the absorbed potassium by the plant is found in straw. Need for potassium is most likely to occur on sandy soils. Calcium Calcium combines with pectin in the plant to form calcium pectate, which is an essential constituent of the cell-wall. It also promotes the activity of soil bacteria concerned with the fixation of free nitrogen or the formation of nitrates from organic forms of nitrogen. Furthermore, it is necessary for the development of a good root system. Magnesium Magnesium is an essential constituent of chlorophyll. It is usually needed by plant in relatively small quantities. Hence its deficiency in the soil is experienced later than that of potassium. Sulphur It involve in chlorophyll production, protein synthesis and plant function and structure. Sulphur forms an important constituent of straw and plant stalks. Iron Iron is necessary for the synthesis of chlorophyll. Mainly a problem in upland soils. Zinc Essential for the transformation of carbohydrates. Regulates consumption of sugars. The function of zinc in plants is as a metal activator of enzymes. Deficiency of zinc in lowland rice occurs in near neural to alkaline soils, particularly in calcareous soils. Availability of both soil and applied zinc is higher in upland soil than in submerged soil. Soil submergence causes decrease in zinc concentration in the soil solution. Rice crop removes 30-40 g Zn per tonne of grain. Boron Boron facilitates the translocation of sugars by forming sugar borate complex. It involves in cell differentiation and development since boron is essential for DNA synthesis. Also involves in fertilization, hormone metabolism etc. Copper It is an important constituent of plastocyanin (copper containing protein). It is also a constituent of several oxidizing enzymes. Important for reproductive growth. Aids in root metabolism and helps in the utilization of proteins. Manganese It is an activator of nitrite reductase and many respiratory enzymes. It is necessary for the evolution of oxygen (photolysis) during photosynthesis. Functions with enzyme systems involved in breakdown of carbohydrates, and nitrogen metabolism. Soil is a source of manganese. Silicon It is an important element for improving plant health and disease resistance. It has the potential to significantly decrease the susceptibility of certain plants to both biotic and abiotic diseases. Beneficial for the growth of paddy. An adequate supply of silica is essential for paddy to give a good yield by increasing the strength and rigidity of cells. Plant roots take up their silica as silicic acid. It is possible that the amount taken up by paddy is equal to the amount of silicic acid present in the water the roots absorb, so that the greater the amount of water transpired, the greater their uptake of silica. Top Nutritional Disorders Nutrient Deficiencies and Toxicities Nitrogen Deficiency Symptoms Stunted growth and yellowish plants. Older leaves of whole plants are yellowish green. Old leaves sometimes all leaves become light green. Deficiency symptoms first appear at the tip and progress along the midrib until the entire leaf is dead. Tips become chlorotic. Leaves narrow, short, erect and lemon-yellowish green. Corrective measures Do not apply large amounts of N to less responsive varieties Choose suitable plant spacing for each cultivar. Adjust the number of splits and timing of N applications according to the crop establishment method. Keep the field flooded to prevent denitrification but avoid N losses from water runoff over bunds immediately after fertilizer application. Soil application of 25 % excess of recommended N. Foliar application of Urea 1% at weekly interval till the symptoms disappear N management in paddy with leaf colour chart (LCC). Yellowing of leaves in paddy indicates the deficiency of nitrogen, but it is difficult to decide the quantity of nitrogen to be applied based on the extent of yellowing. The actual requirement of nitrogen by the crop can be correctly assessed by leaf colour chart. The leaf colour chart consists of 6 -7 green strips, 1st strip with light green colour and the last strip (6th or 7th) with dark green colour, and in between strips (2nd to 5th) are with varying intensity of green colour. Use of leaf colour chart Select fully opened disease free new leaf i.e. third leaf from the top as index leaf in paddy plant for assessing the leaf colour and ten leaves to be selected from ten plants in the field. Match the colour of the selected leaves by keeping the middle of the leaves on the colour strips of leaf colour chart and assess the colour intensity ( LCC value) during morning hours (8-10 am). Assess the intensity of leaf colour each time at a particular time by a particular individual. Take average of two if the leaf colour matches between two colour strips of the chart. Commence the assessment of the leaf colour with LCC at 14 DAT in transplanted rice or 21 DAS in direct seeded rice and continue up to flower initiation/heading at an interval of 7-10 days. Critical LCC value varies with the type of paddy genotypes. LCC critical value is 3.0 in low N response cultures. In Tamilnadu LCC critical value is 3.0 in low N response cultures like White Ponni and 4.0 in other cultivars and hybrids. Assess the average LCC values of 10 leaf samples. When the average LCC value of ten leaves or when the LCC values of five or more leaves found below the critical LCC limit fixed for that genotype, then top dress nitrogen depending on the crop growth and stage. If six or more leaves read below the specified threshold value, N can be applied @ 35 kg N/ha in dry season and 30 kg N/ha in wet season per application per ha. If the value is above the threshold value, there is no need for top dressing during that week. Nitrogen toxicity symptoms: Plants are dark green in colour Abundant foliage Restricted root system Flowering and seed setting may be retarded. Nitrogen sources Farmyard manure, Green manures, Biofertilizers (Rhizobium, AzollaAzospirillum, Azotobacter) Castor cake, Neem cake, Urea, Diammonium phosphate, Ammonium nitrate, Ammonium sulphate. Phosphorus Deficiency symptoms Plants stunted with reduced tillering. Leaves narrow, short, very erect âdirtyâ dark green. Older leaves turn brownish red and purple colors develop in leaves. Stems thin and spindly. Poor tillering/branching. Poor root growth. Corrective measures Application of phosphobacteria to the soil as seed coating or as seedling dip. Application on P fertilizer 15-30 kg P/ha. Rock phosphate broadcast before flooding when soil pH is low. Phosphorus sources: Farmyard manure, Biofertilizers (Phosphate solubilizers) Castor cake, Neem cake,Super phosphate (single),Super phosphate (Double),Super phosphate (Triple), Basic slag, Mussori, Diammonium phosphate (SPIC), Ammonium phosphate (Gromor) Phosphorus toxicity (Injury due to excess P application) 1. Fixed in soil â not available to plants 2. Leads to Zinc deficiency Potassium Deficiency symptoms Dark green plants with yellowish. Brown leaf margins and brown necrotic spots on the tips of older leaves. Rusty brown spots on the panicles and poor grain formation. Weak stem leads to lodging. Corrective measures: Soil application of 25% excess of recommended K. Foliar application of 1% KCL Spread and incorporate the straw evenly over the field before burning. Ash from burnt straw heaps should also be spread over the field. Potassium sources Farmyard manure, Castor cake, Neem cake, Muriate of potash (KCl), Potassium sulphate Injury due to excess K application Excess of this element tends to delay maturity Leads to calcium magnesium and iron deficiencies. Calcium Deficiency symptoms White or bleached, rolled, and curled tips of youngest leaves. Necrosis along the lateral margins of leaves. Old leaves turn brown and die. Stunting and death of growing points Corrective measures: Apply farmyard manure or straw (incorporated or burned) to balance Ca removal in soils containing small concentrations of Calcium Fertilizers. Apply CaCl2 or Ca containing foliar sprays for rapid treatment of severe Ca deficiency. Apply gypsum in Ca deficient high pH soils,e.g., on sodic & high K soils. Apply lime on acid soils to raise pH and Ca availability. Apply pyrites to mitigate the effects of NaHCO3- rich water on Ca uptake. Calcium sources: Farmyard manure, Calcium chloride. Gypsum, dolomite, lime, pyrites, single superphosphate or triple superphosphate. Magnesium Deficiency symptoms: Leaf chlorotic with white tips. Pale-colored plants with orange-yellow interveinal chlorosis on older leaves and later on younger leaves. Chlorosis progresses to yellowing and finally necrosis in older leaves in severe cases wavy and droopy leaves. Reduced number of spikelets and grain quality. Corrective measures: Rapid correction of Mg deficiency symptoms is achieved by applying a soluble Mg source such as kieserite or Mg chloride. Foliar application of liquid fertilizers containing Mg (e.g.,Mgcl 22%) Magnesium sources: Farmyard manure, Magnesium chloride, dolomite. Sulphur Deficiency symptoms: Yellowing or pale green whole plant. Young leaves chlorotic or light green colored with the tips becoming necrotic. Lower leaves not showing necrosis. Leaves pale yellow. Effect on yield is more pronounced when S deficiency occurs during vegetative growth. Corrective measures: Incorporate straw instead of completely removing or burning it. About 40-60% of the S contained in straw is lost during burning. Carry out dry tillage after harvesting, to increase the rate of sulfide oxidation during the follow period. Applying 15-20 kg S ha-1 gives a residual effect that can supply the S needed for two subsequent rice crops. Sulphur sources: Ammonium sulfate, Single superphosphate, Potassium sulfate, gypsum and S-coated urea. Iron Deficiency symptoms: Interveinal yellowing. Chlorosis of whole leaves and emerging leaves. Entire plants becomes chlorotic. Corrective measures: Apply solid FeSO4 (30 kg Fe/ha) next to rice rows or broadcast. Foliar applications of FeSO4 (2-3% solution) 2-3 applications at 2 week intervals. Use acidifying fertilizers (e.g., ammonium sulfate instead of urea) on high-pH soils. Grow tolerant cultivars for low soil Fe availability. Iron sources: Soluble ferrous sulfate (20-33% Fe), ferrous ammonium sulfate (14% Fe), and iron chelates (5 to 14% Fe). Zinc Deficiency symptoms: Dusty brown spots on upper leaves. Stunted growth of plants. Decreases tillering and increase spikelet sterility. Leaf base of younger leaves become chlorotic brown and blotches/streaks on lower leaves. Corrective measures: Broadcast ZnSO4 in nursery seedbed. Dip seedlings or presoak seeds in 2-4% ZnO suspension. It is enough to apply 12.5 kg zinc sulphate /ha, if green manure (6.25 t/ha) or enriched FYM, is applied. Apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate with 50 kg sand before transplanting. Apply 5-10 kg Zn ha-1 as Zn sulfate, apply 0.5 â 1.5 % ZnSO4/ha as a foliar spray at tillering (25-30 DAT), 2-3 repeated applications at intervals of 10-14 days. Zn chelates (e.g., Zn-EDTA) can be used for foliar application. Zinc sources: Zinc sulfate, Zinc carbonate, Zinc chloride, Zinc chelate, Zinc oxide. Zinc toxicity symptoms: Excess zinc commonly produces iron chlorosis in plants. Aluminium Toxicity symptoms: Orange-yellow interveinal chlorosis on leaves followed by leaf tip death and leaf margin scorch. Necrosis of chlorotic areas during severe Al toxicity. Stunted and deformed roots in susceptible cultivars. Corrective measures: Delay planting until pH has increased sufficiently after flooding (to immobilize Al). Plant Al-tolerant cultivars (IR43, CO 37, and Basmati 370) which accumulate less Al in their foliage and take up and use Ca and P efficiently in the presence of Al. Apply 1-3 t lime/ha to raise pH. Boron Deficiency symptoms: White and rolled leaf tips of young leaves. Reduction in plant height. Death of growing points, but new tillers continue to emerge during severe deficiency. Plants unable to produce panicles if affected by B deficiency. Corrective measure: Avoid excessive leaching (percolation). Apply B in soluble forms (borax) for rapid treatment of B deficiency (0.5-3 kg B/ ha), broadcast and incorporated before planting, top dressed or as foliar spray during vegetative rice growth. Boron sources: Anhydrous borax, Fertilizer borate, borax. Toxicity symptoms: Chlorosis of tips and margins of older leaves as initial symptoms. Dark brown elliptical spots on discolored areas two to three weeks later followed by browning and drying up. Necrotic spots prominent at panicle initiation. Corrective measures: Plant B-toxicity tolerant varieties (e.g., IR42, IR46, IR48, and IR 54). Use surface water with a low B content for irrigation. Plough when the soil is dry so that B accumulates in the topsoil. Leach with water containing a small amount of B. Copper Deficiency symptoms: Leaves develop chlorotic streaks on either side of the midrib. Dark brown necrotic lesions on leaf tips, Leaves often bluish green and chlorotic near the leaf tip. New leaves do not unroll and the distal parts of leaves maintain a needle like appearance. Reduced tillering and increased spikelet sterility Corrective measures: Dip seedling roots in 1% CuSO4 suspensions for 1 hr before transplanting. Avoid overliming of acid soils because it may reduce Cu uptake. On Cu-deficient soils, apply CuO or CuSO4(5-10 kg Cu/ha at 5-year intervals) for long-term maintenance of available soil Cu (broadcast and incorporate in soil). Copper sources: Cupric sulfate, Cu oxide Manganese Deficiency symptoms: Pale greyish green interveinal chlorosis spreads from the tip to the leaf base. Necrotic brown spots develop later and leaf becomes dark brown. Newly emerging leaves short, narrow and light green. Deficient plants shorter, with fewer leaves, weigh less, and smaller root system at tillering. Corrective measures: Apply MnSO4 or finely ground MnO (5-20 kg Mn/ha) in bunds along rice rows. Apply foliar MnSO4 for rapid treatment of Mn deficiency(1-5 kg Mn/ha in about 200 L water/ha). Use acid-forming fertilizers, e.g., ammonia sulfate [(NH4)2SO4] instead of urea. Manganese sources: Mn sulfate, Mn chloride Toxicity symptoms: Yellowish brown spots between leaf veins, extending to the whole interveinal area. Brown spots on veins of lower leaf blades and leaf sheaths. Leaf tips dry out eight weeks after planting. Chlorosis of younger (upper) leaves, with symptoms similar to those of Fe chlorosis. Stunted plants, reduced tillering and sterility results in reduced grain yield. Corrective measures: Coat seeds with oxidants (e.g., Ca peroxide) to improve germination and seedling emergence by increasing the supply of O2. Apply lime on acid soils to reduce the concentration of active Mn. Mn uptake is reduced in the presence of ammonia. Silicon Deficiency symptoms: Leaves and culms become soft and droopy thus increasing mutual shading. Reduces photosynthetic activity. Severe Si deficiency reduces the number of panicles m2 and the number of filled spikelets per panicle. Si-deficient plants are particularly susceptible to lodging. Corrective measures: For more rapid correction of Si deficiency, granular silicate fertilizers should be applied: Calcium silicate 120-200 kg/ha , Potassium silicate 40-60 kg/ha. In the long term, Si deficiency is prevented by not removing the straw from the field following harvest. Recycle rice straw (5-6% Si) and rice husks (10% Si). Avoid applying excessive amounts of N fertilizer, which increases yield and total uptake of N and Si, but also decreases the Si concentration in straw because of excessive biomass growth. Silicon sources: Calcium silicate, potassium silicate, blast furnace slag. Sodium Toxicity symptoms: Leaves short, narrow and brittle. Leaves initially show dark green colour, later become bleached and turn yellow to pink and necrotic Corrective measures: Soil application of gypsum at 100-200 kg/ha and leach with water. Sulphur Toxicity symptoms: Interveinal chlorosis of emerging leaves. Coarse, sparse, dark brown to black roots. Fresh uprooted rice has poorly developed root systems with many black roots. Increased occurrence of diseases. Corrective measures: Apply K, P, and Mg fertilizers. Apply Fe (salts, oxides) on low-Fe soils to increase immobilization of H2S as FeS. Avoid continuous flooding and use intermittent irrigation in soils that contain large concentrations of S. Carry out dry tillage after harvest to increase S and Fe oxidation during the fallow period.

Pongamia glabra) Ipomoea cornea Neem (Azadirachta indica) Sesbania grandiflora Advantages of green Manuring Green manuring builds up soil structure and improves tilth. Improves aeration in rice soils by stimulating activities of surface film of algae and bacteria. Harbour N fixing bacteria, rhizobia in root nodules and fix atmospheric N (60 to 100 kg N/ha). Promotes formation of crumbs in heavy soils leading to aeration and drainage. Vitamin and protein content of rice increased. Biofertilizer Biofertilizers are ready to use live formulates of such beneficial microorganisms which on application to seed, root or soil mobilize the availability of nutrients by their biological activity in particular, and help to build up the micro-flora and in turn the soil health in general. Bio-fertilizers are eco friendly and are environmentally safe. They form not only part of integrated nutrients but are of low cost. The bio-fertilizers used for rice crop are azolla, Blue green algae, Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Phosphobacteria, Phosphate solubilisers and Mycorhiza. Azolla Azolla is a fresh water fern. 0.5 -1 t of biomass of azolla /ha is used for paddy in two ways either as green manure before transplanting, or as dual crop in 7 DAT. It releases the nitrogen to the rice crop only after complete decomposition (8-10 days). It also enhances the availability of phosphorus than chemical fertilizer on 40th day besides improving the C:N ratio of soils. Blue green algae These are photosynthetic prokaryotic microorganisms capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. It can be applied to rice crop at 10 kg/ha on 10 DAT. âAlgalisationâ increases the nitrogen content of both grain and straw besides increasing soil fertility. It can fix 20-30 kg N/ha. Azotobacter Azotobacter is a free living nitrogen fixing bacteria. It can be applied to rice through seed or seedling or soil. Azospirillium Inoculation with Azospirillum promotes early tillering and also the growth of rice and significantly increases filling rate of grain and the grain weight per plant at harvest. Phosphobacteria A large proportion of the phosphatic fertilizer applied to soil is fixed by conversion into insoluble forms of phosphorus which is not available to plants. Only 20-25 per cent of phosphorous is available to plants. This insoluble and unavailable phosphorus remains unutilized by plants in soil. The bacteria, which dissolve the undissolved form of phosphorus is called 'Phosphobacteria'. The organic acids produced by phosphobacteria dissolve the insoluble (fixed) form of phosphorous in soil and make it available to plants. Azospirillium,Phosphobacteria,Azotobacter Number of packets/hectare is Method of application Number of Packets/ha Seed treatment 5 Nursery application 10 Seedling dip 5 Main field (Soil application) 10 Total 30 Mycorrhiza It occurs naturally in low land and upland rice. It mobilizes the phosphorus required by rice. It also provides nutrients such as iron, zinc, copper, manganese etc. Endomycorrhiza are obligate symbionts and can be maintained only on live plants inoculated with spores of a species and collecting the pieces of roots with soil. The root biomass heavily infected by a specific mycorrhizal fungus serves as the inoculum for subsequent plots. Phosphate Solubilisers This type of biofertilizers solubilises phosphates in the soil and render them in available form for low land and upland rice. Bacteria like Bacillus megatherium var phosphaticum, Bacillus polymixa, Pseudomonas fluorscens, Pseudomonas striata fungi like Pencillium digitatum, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus awamori were found to have a strong phosphate dissolving ability. For semi-dry rice, hardened seeds are treated with Pseudomonas fluorscens 10g/kg of seed. Methods of application of Biofertilizer Bacterial biofertilizers are supplied as carrier based inoculants. Peat or lignite is used as carrier material. Carrier based bacterial inoculants are applied by the following methods. Seed treatment. Seedling root dip and Main field application Seed Treatment One package of the inoculant is mixed with 200ml of rice kanji to make slurry. The seeds required for an acre are mixed in the slurry so as to have a uniform coating of the inoculant over the seeds and then shade dried for 30 minutes. The shade dried seeds should be sown within 24 hours. One packet of the inoculant (200g) is sufficient to treat 10 kg of seeds. Seedling Root Dip This method is used for transplanted crops. Two packets of the inoculant is mixed in 40 litres of water. The root portion of the seedlings required for an acre is dipped in the mixture for 5 to 10 minutes and then transplanted. Main field Preparation Four packets of the inoculant is mixed with 20 kgs of dried powdered farm yard manure and broadcast in one acre of main field just before transplanting. Combained application of Bacterial Biofertilizers Phosphobacteria can be mixed with Azospirillum. The inoculants should be mixed in equal quantities and applied as mentioned above. Organic Manuring practices TamilNadu In nursery, apply 1 tonne of fully decomposed FYM or compost to 20 cents nursery and spread the manure uniformly on dry soil. In main field, apply 12.5 t of FYM or compost or green leaf manure @ 6.25 t/ha. If green manure is raised @ 20 kg /ha in situ, incorporate it to a depth of 15 cm using a green manure trampler or tractor. In the place of green manure, press-mud / composted coir-pith can also be used. Kerala Apply organic manure in the form of farmyard manure or compost or green leaf @ of 5 t/ha and incorporate into the soil while ploughing. Cowpea may be raised as an intercrop in dry seeded low land (semi-dry) rice by sowing 12.5 kg seed/ha along with rice to serve as a source of green manure. When the rice field gets submerged with the onset of southwest monsoon, cowpea at the age of about six weeks and at active vegetative stage decays and gets self-incorporated in the soil adding substantial quantity of green manure. Such a system of concurrent growing of cowpea also reduces weed pressure in semi-dry rice. Karnataka Drill sown paddy : Sow sunhemp green manure seeds @10kg/ha mixed with paddy seeds. Carry out hodta operation (Planking) in standing water after 40 DAS for in situ incorporation of sunhemp in the soil which will decompose easily and early and add to organic matter to the soil maintaining the soil fertility. (OR) Ex situ incorporation of green leaf manuring of Eupatorium/parthenium/cassia and other weeds green material @ 5 t/ha in between the two paddy rows by carrying out hodta operation. Provides only 50% nutrients to maintain good yield. Transplanted paddy: Sow green manure seeds of Sesbania rostrata (@ 25kg/ha) along with the application of entire P2O5 recommended for paddy, eight weeks before transplanting of paddy, then in situ incorporate the green manure crop by carrying out hodta operation ( Planking) seven weeks after sowing. Transplant paddy seedlings after one week of incorporation along with the application of 50% recommended nitrogen for paddy. Top Fertilizer Requirements (1) Fertilizer Requirements These products are quick acting, even in cool soils and they are inexpensive. They are the most effective means of increasing crop production and supplement nutrient supply in the soil, especially to correct yield-limiting factors. (1) a)Tamil Nadu Transplanted Puddled Low Land Rice Blanket recommendation (Kg/ha) â 150:50:50 In nursery, before the last puddling apply basal application of DAP (40 kg) is recommended when the seedlings are to be pulled out in 20-25 days after sowing. For clay soils where root snapping is a problem, 4kg of Gypsum and 1 kg of DAP per cent can be applied at 10 DAS. Direct wet seeded puddled lowland rice, Dry seeded rainfed un-puddled lowland rice and Rainfed upland rice Blanket recommendation (Kg/ha) â 50:25:25 Semidry System-Dry seeded rice in un-puddled low land Blanket recommendation (Kg/ha) â:75:25:37.5 (b) Kerala Stages of application: 1. For short duration varieties, N is applied in three equal splits viz., basal, active tillering, and active panicle initiation stages. The recommended P is fully applied as basal. K is applied in two equal splits viz., basal and active panicle initiation stages. 2. For medium and long duration varieties, N are applied in two equal splits viz., basal and active panicle initiation stages. The recommended P is fully applied as basal. K is applied in two equal splits viz., basal and active panicle initiation stages. 3. For direct seeded crop, the basal application should be done one week after sowing. (c) Karnataka Zone 1 - North Eastern Transition Zone Zone 2 - North Eastern Dry Zone Zone 3 - Northern Dry Zone Zone 4 - Central Dry Zone Zone 5 - Eastern Dry Zone Zone 6 - Southern dry Zone Zone 7- Southern Transition Zone Zone 8 - Northern Transition Zone Zone 9 - Hill Zone Zone 10 - Coastal Zone (2) Method of Fertilizer application Soil application Basal application Apply 25 % recommended dose of N and K as basal. P may be applied fully as basal and incorporated. Apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate mixed with 50 kg dry sand just before transplanting. Apply 500 kg of gypsum/ha (as source of Ca and S nutrients) at last ploughing. Top dressing Apply 25 % recommended dose of N and K each as top dressing at active tillering, panicle initiation and heading stages. Foliar Nutrition in paddy In recent yearâs soluble fertilizers otherwise known as foliar fertilizers like Polyfeed and Multi 'K' were introduced in rice growing states. Polyfeed contains 19: 19: 19 NPK with 6 micro-nutrients like iron, manganese, boron, zinc, copper and molybdenum, while multi K contains 13: 0: 46 NPK. These fertilizers provide nutrients to the plant by foliar application as these fertilizers are completely soluble in water. These fertilizers have no other impurities like sodium and chloride and they are 100 % nutrients and these nutrients are easily absorbed through the leaves. In certain occasions like prolonged drought, there is no scope to apply fertilizers to the soil for want of moisture. Like wise in flooded conditions due to continuous rains fertilizers could not be applied to the soil. In such special circumstances these soluble fertilizers are must to protect the crop against hunger and this forms a compulsory act of crisis management. And the foliar application of Speciality fertilizers plays an important role in supplying the nutrients at critical stages of flowering and grain formation. Under special conditions of drought and waterlogging, apply N as foliar spray. Urea may be applied as a low volume spray at 15% concentration using power sprayer or at 5% concentration using a high volume sprayer, the quantity applied in one application being limited to 15 kg/ha. Foliar spray of Urea (10 g/lit) + DAP (20 g/lit) + KCl (10 g/lit) at PI and 10 days later for all varieties. If deficiency symptom appears, foliar application of 0.5% Zinc sulphate + 1.0% urea can be given at 15 days interval until the Zn deficiency symptoms disappear. Growth Regulators Foliar spray of Brassinosteriods 0.3 ppm at Panicle Initiation and Flowering stages increased the grain yield. For increasing the rooting under broadcast method of planting, soaking roots in 25 ppm Induction of better rooting for early establishment in rice, root dipping for 16 hours in thiamin solution. Top Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) Integrated nutrient management (INM) aims at reducing the chemical fertilizer applied and improving its efficiency through combined use of different sources of plant nutrients such as Fertilizers, 1. Organic manures, 2. Green manures, 3. Crop residues, 4. Biofertilisers and 5.Industrial wastes / soil conditioners in balanced proportions, depending on their availability and suitability in a specific rice ecosystem. Sources of nutrients: 1. Organic manures / compost â 12.5 t of FYM 2. Green manures / green leaf manures / crop residues - 6.25 t/ha 3. Fertilizers â Apply blanket recommendation as per the ecosystem. Biofertilizers: 1. Azolla âas green rmanure @ 6t /ha, as dual crop (0.5 t/ha) in 7 DAT 2. Blue green algae - 10 kg/ha on 10 DAT 3. Azotobacter /Azospirillium /Phosphobacteria - 10 packets (soil application) 4. Azophos â 20 packets (soil application) Micronutrients: Apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate mixed with 50 kg dry sand just before transplanting. It is enough to apply 12.5 kg zinc sulphate /ha, if green manure (6.25 t/ha) or enriched FYM, is applied. If deficiency symptom appears, foliar application of 0.5% Zinc sulphate + 1.0% urea can be given at 15 days interval until the Zn deficiency symptoms disappear. Dip roots of the seedlings in 1% Zinc sulphate solution for one minute before transplanting. Top Copyright Â© TNAU | All Rights Reserved

Post Harvest Technology HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Harvesting Post Harvest Technologies Rice Products Processing Machinery Suppliers Post Harvest Technology Harvesting For paddy, harvesting refers to the cutting and gathering of panicles attached to the stalks. Harvesting at the right time and in the right way maximizes grain yield and minimizes grain losses and quality deterioration. Once the plants have reached full growth (approximately three months after planting) and the grains begin to ripen-the tops begin to droop and the stem yellows-the water is drained from the fields. As the fields dry, the grains ripen further and harvesting is commenced. Stage of harvest : Many factors must be considered to obtain optimum rice harvest. The grain must be mature, high in quality and have proper moisture content. Field should be sufficiently dry to support harvesting and transport. Timely harvesting ensures good grain quality, high market value and improved consumer acceptance. The right stage for harvesting is when about 80% panicles have 80 % ripened spike lets and their upper portion is straw colored. The grain contains about 20% of moisture. Rice should be harvested when the grains on lower part of the panicle are in hard dough stage. Maturity may be hastened by 3-4 days by spraying 20 % NaCl a week before harvest to escape monsoon rains Harvesting methods : Depending on the size of the operation and the amount of mechanization, rice is either harvested by hand or machine. The different harvesting systems are as follows: Manual harvesting Manual harvesting makes use of traditional threshing tools such as threshing racks, simple treadle threshers and animals for trampling or by hand using sharp knives or sickles. Gives 55-60 % grain recovery. Manual harvesting and machine threshing Rice is manually threshed, then cleaned with a machine thresher. Machine reaping and machine threshing A reaper cuts and lays the crop in a line. Threshing and cleaning can then be performed manually or by machine. Combine harvesting The combine harvester combines all operations from paddy harvesting to rice extraction - cutting, handling, threshing and cleaning. Gives 50 % recovery. Average yield : A well-managed crop of mid-late duration varieties yield about 60-70 quintals/ ha. Short duration varieties yield about 45-55 quintals. About 40-60 quintals/ ha of fodder also becomes available per season. Top Post Harvest Technologies Threshing Threshing is the process of beating paddy plants in order to separate the seeds or grains from the straw. To maintain the high quality of the harvested grains, it should be threshed immediately after harvesting. Avoid field drying and stacking for several days as it affects grain quality due to over drying. Stacked grains of high moisture content results in discoloration or yellowing. Threshing can be done manually or mechanically Manual threshing The manual methods of threshing are treading by feet, flail method, and beating stalks against tubs, boards or racks. Threshing can be done by trampling using bullocks, rubbing with bare human feet (in hills) or lifting the bundles and striking them on the raised wooden platform. Pedal threshers are also used. Freshly threshed rice must be dried well in the sun. Machine threshing Mechanical threshing removes rice grains from the rice plant, speeds up threshing (thus reducing losses), and reduces labor requirements. Power driven stationary threshers are also used. Freshly threshed rice must be dried well in the sun Top Drying Drying is the process of removal of excess moisture from the grains. Once dried, the rice grain, now called rough rice, is ready for processing. Proper drying results in increased storage life of the grains, prevention of deterioration in quality, reduction of biological respiration that leads to quality loss of grains, and optimum milling recovery. Methods of drying Sun drying Mechanical drying Chemical drying Sun Drying Sun drying is a traditional method of drying the paddy grains. Sundrying is the most economical method of drying grains. Grains are spread on drying surfaces such as concrete pavement, mats, plastic sheets and even on fields to dry naturally. Mechanical Drying Mechanical drying process means drying the grains by ventilating natural or heated air through the grain mass to get it evaporated the moisture from it. Mechanical dryers are more reliable since drying could be done anytime of the year. Chemical Drying Chemical drying method involves the spraying of common salt solution with specific gravity of 1.1 to 1.2 on the ears of the mature paddy crop. This treatment reduces the moisture content from 29% to 14.5% after four days. Top Parboiling Parboiling is a premilling hydrothermal treatment given to unhulled rice (rough rice) to improve its milling quality, nutritive value, cooking quality and storability. The process is accomplished in three steps: soaking, steaming and drying. Traditionally, parboiling was done either by single or double boiling method. Single boiling method involves soaking the unhulled rice in water at room temperature followed by open steaming for 20-30 minutes using iron kettles and then sun drying. In double streaming method, the unhusked rice is first steamed to raise its temperature and then soaked in cold water for 24-36 hrs. After soaking, it is steamed second time for 20-30 minutes followed by sun drying. Milling Milling is the process wherein the rice grain is transformed into a form suitable for human consumption, therefore, has to be done with utmost care to prevent breakage of the kernel and improve the recovery. Brown rice is milled further to create more visually appealing white rice. After harvesting and drying, the paddy is subjected to the primary milling operation which includes de-husking as well as the removal of bran layers (polishing) before it is consumed. In this process the rice which is obtained after milling is called raw rice. Another process through which rice is obtained after milling is called "Parboiling Rice." Nearly 60% of the total rice produced in India is subjected to parboiling. Rice milling losses may be qualitative or quantitative in nature. Quantitative or physical losses are manifested by low milling recovery while low head rice recovery or high percentage of broken kernel reflects the qualitative loss in rice grains. Methods of Millling : Traditional Method Before the advent of mechanical milling, hand-pounding traditional method of rice milling was in practice. In fact, hand-pounding rice has got more nutritive value as compared to machine milling rice. In hand-pounding, a variety of implements is used such as: Mortor and Pestle Dhenki Hand Stone (Chakki) Mechanical Method With the introduction of mechanized mills, hand-pounding method has steadily decreased because it could not compete with machine mills. The conventional mills in use can be categorized into three main types: Huller mills Sheller-Huller mills Sheller-Cone Polisher mills. Top Cleaning and Hulling At the processing plant, the rice is cleaned and hulled. At this point, brown rice needs no further processing. If white rice is desired, the brown rice is milled to remove the outer bran layers. Hulling is the process to remove the hull from the kernel. Manual hulling: Hulling can be done by hand by rolling or grinding the rough rice between stones. Mechanical hulling: The rough rice is first cleaned by passing through a number of sieves that sift out the debris. Blown air removes top matter. Once clean, the rice is hulled by a machine that mimics the action of the hand held stones. The shelling machine loosens the hulls from the rice. About 80-90% of the kernel hulls are removed during this process. From the shelling machine, the grains and hulls are conveyed to a stone reel that aspirates the waste hulls and moves the kernels to a machine that separates the hulled from the unhulled grains. By shaking the kernels, the paddy machine forces the heavier unhulled grains to one side of the machine, while the lighter weight rice falls to the other end. The unhulled grains are then siphoned to another batch of shelling machines to complete the hulling process. Polishing Polishing is the process of removal of bran layer in brown rice. After harvesting and drying, the paddy is subjected to the primary milling operation which includes de-husking as well as the removal of bran layers (polishing) before it is consumed. The rice obtained after this process is called raw rice. Quality and Grading Quality of rice is not always easy to define as it depends on the consumer and the intended end use for the grain. Grain quality is not just dependent on the variety of rice, but quality also depends on the crop production environment, harvesting, processing and milling systems. Characteristics Considered for Grading of Milled Rice Dead rice, brokens and brewers percentages Defectives Foreign matter Presence of paddy Whiteness Chalkiness Moisture content Objectives of establishing standards and grades To ensure only edible rice reaches the consumer. To improve post harvest practices so as to eliminate or reduce waste. To improve agronomic practices to increase farm yields. To improve processing practices for better milling recoveries and for market expansion. To protect consumers from price/quality manipulation. Grades of Indian Rice Common variety: Short bold & long bold rice Fine variety: Medium slender rice Superfine variety: Long slender & short slender rice Top Storage Storage is the process of keeping grains, whether in bags or in bulk, in a storage structure designed to protect the stored product from inclement weather and pests for a short or long period of time to await processing or movement to other location. Grains are stored for either of the following reasons: To provide uniform supply of food throughout the year, because grains are produced seasonally while consumption is fairly uniform throughout the year. To provide reserve for contingencies such as flood, drought and other calamities. To speculate on a good price either in domestic or in the export market. The grains are stored at three different levels, such as: Producer's Level Trader's Level Urban Organizational Storage Level The methods followed for storing the grains are: Storage in bags Loose storage Storage in bags is convenient for short term storage, where grain is intended for very early onward movement. For short term storage, no control measures against insects are needed. In loose/bulk storage method, large quantity of grains can be stored in per unit volume of space and the infestation of insects/pests is lower. The basic requirements of a good storage practice are: a healthy, clean, and uniformly dried grain, and a structure that will maintain a suitable environment that will prevent pests. Top Rice Products By Products of Rice Modernization of rice milling Industry also results in production of quality by-products viz., broken rice, husk and rice bran. Technology is now available for the production of value- added products from these by-products. Broken rice The broken rice is widely used in the food preparations and in the industries for making flour and in the manufacture of baby foods. The starch extracted from broken rice finds wider application in the pharmaceutical, textile and other industries. Rice husk Rice husk that contains about 38% cellulose and 32% lignin and is one of the most abundant renewable agriculture based fuel materials. The production of rice husk is about 80 million tonnes per year, equivalent in energy to about 170 million barrels of oil. Paddy husk contains about 22 per cent ash of which 95 per cent is silica. Because of its high silica content, it is used as an abrasive. Large quantities of husk are used in India as fuel for boilers, kilns and household purposes. Rice straw Each tonne of paddy produces an equal amount of straw as by-products. Straw can be used as ruminant fodder, stable bedding material, raw material in mushroom cultivation and industrial processes like papermaking etc. It is also used as fuel for cooking. Paddy straw is used as substrate for Mushroom production. For 100 kg Mushroom production - Dry paddy straw (not more than one year old) -100 kg is required. Preparation of Substrate-Use Dried paddy straw, 500 gms per bed. Cut the paddy straw into small bits of 3 to 5 cm. and soak it in cold water for 6-8 hours. Take it out and then immerse in boiling water for 15-30 minutes and drain off excess water. Dry the straw in the shade for 2 hours and then use. Rice bran Commercially rice bran is the most valuable by-product, which is characterized by its high fat (15 to 20%) and protein content (12%). Because of its nutritional value, it is being used as feed for poultry and livestock. More stable defatted bran containing higher percentage of protein, vitamins and minerals is an excellent ingredient for both food and feed. It is generally contaminated with husk, which lowers its nutritive value. Rice bran oil Bran oil is obtained by the extraction of rice bran with solvents. The oil contains a high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids, yet it is quite stable because of the presence of natural antioxidants. When refined, bleached and deodorized, it is used for salad dressing and as cooking oil. Bran after solvent extraction has a higher percentage of protein than the original material. With its low fat content it keeps well. Importance of rice bran oil Rice bran oil contains components of vitamin E that may benefit health. The unique components, such as or tocotrienol, have been drawing people's attention. Oryzanol reduces the harmful cholesterol (LDL) without reducing good cholesterol (HDL). Tocotrienol, is highlighted as the most precious and powerful vitamin E existing in nature and is said to have an anti-cancer effect. Top VALUE ADDITION Processed Products Fermented Products Based on Rice Extruded Products 1. RICE - PROCESSED PRODUCT Parched rice It is prepared by throwing rice in sand heated to a high temperature in an iron or mud pan. On stirring, rice begins to crackle and swell. Then the content of the pan are removed and sieved to separate the parched rice from sand. Parboiled rice is used for making grayish to brilliant white colour parched rice and sold either salted or unsalted. Expanded rice (Pori) Expanded rice (murmura, pori, muri) is a traditional convenience food widely consumed in India. In the traditional process, the paddy is soaked in water preferably over night until saturation, drained and then either steamed or dry roasted in sand for parboiling. The parboiled paddy is milled, salted and again roasted in sand for expansion. Puffed rice: This popular ready-to-eat snack product is obtained by puffing milled parboiled rice. In the traditional process rice is gently heated on the furnace without sand to reduce the moisture content slightly. It is then mixed with salt solution and again roasted on furnace in small batches with sand on a strong fire for a few seconds to produce the expanded rice. Rice expands about 8 times retaining the grain shape and is highly porous and crisp. Parched paddy or puffed paddy :(using paddy) Sun dried paddy is filled in mud jars and is moistened with hot water. After 2-3 min. the water is decanted and the jars are kept in an inverted position for 8-10 hours. Next the paddy is exposed to the sun for a short time and then parched in hot sand as in the preparation of parched rice. The parched grains are sieved to remove sand and winnowed to separate the husk. Puffed rice from parboiled rice The rice is soaked in salt water to increase the moisture to about 20%. The moist rice is introduced into a hot vessel at about 250-275Â°C for 30-40 seconds. The rice puffs suddenly. Popped rice This is prepared from raw paddy. The paddy at a moisture content of 12-14% is directly roasted in iron pans using sand as a medium at a temperature of 150-200Â°C. Flaked rice is value added product prepared from paddy. Traditionally, it is prepared from soaked paddy, after heat treatment and immediate flattening using a flaking machine (an edge runner). Flaked rice is thin and papery and of white colour. Quick cooking rice is made by steeping polished rice in water to a moisture content of 35 per cent, cooking under pressure and drying. Derived products Polished rice may be precooked and canned as rice pudding and also used to make dry breakfast cereals. Top 2. RICE - FERMENTED PRODUCTS Idli Idli is a small, white acid â leavened, and steamed cake made by bacterial fermentation (12-18 hours) of a thick batter made from rice and dehulled blackgram dhal. Idlies are soft, moist and spongy had a desirable sour flavour. For idli, the rice was coarsely ground and the black gram was finely ground. Dosa Dosa is another common fermented product used in India. This is prepared from a fermented batter of rice and pulse in the proportions ranging from 6:1 to 10:1. Both the ingredients are finely ground, unlike in the idli batter which contains the rice component in a coarse consistency. The dosa batter is very thin and dosa is baked on a hot pan. Other fermented products Some other fermented foods based on rice used in the country are ambali, prepared from a thick fermented batter of finger millet flour and rice, ganji, fermented, surplus water from cooked rice and fermented rice or kali which is left over cooked rice to which water is added and the mixture allowed to ferment overnight. Top 3. RICE- EXTRUDED PRODUCTS Extrusion is a process that combines several unit operation including mixing. kneading, shearing, heating, cooling shaping and forming. It involves compressing, and working raw material eg. Flours, starches, proteins, salt, sugar and other minor ingredients to form a semi solid mass under a variety of controlled conditions and then forcing it to pass through a restricted opening such as a shaped hole or slot at a predetermined rate. Heat is applied directly by steam injection or indirectly through a heated barrel. The final process temperature in the cooking extruder can be high as 200Â°C but the time of exposure to heat is relatively short (10-60 seconds). The extrusion cooking is also called a high temperature short time (HTST) process. Extruded products Rice based extruded products include sevai, idiappam, murukku (chakli) rice based vadagam etc. Rice based noodles and noodles from fermented rice flour are popular. Idiappam Idiappam is a traditional food prepared from the combination of parboiled rice and raw rice. It is consumed as breakfast / dinner for the peoples especially South Indians. It is a steamed product and consumed as either in the form of sweet or savoury dish. Murukku Raw rice and black gram were ground in a mill separately and sieved through 80 BS sieve and used for the preparation of murukku instant mix. Vadagam The ingredients were mixed and 250 ml of water was added and cooked for 10 minutes until a thick extrudable paste was formed. The hot paste was extruded in hand extruder (dia 5 mm) and dried in sun for about five hours. The dried vadagam sample was packed in a polyethylene bags and sealed.

Rice Ecosystem HOME ABOUT US CONTACT US Wet System Dry System Semidry System Hybrid seedproduction Seed Productionin varieties Rice Ecosystem Systems of rice cultivation in various rice growing areas are largely depends upon the crop growing conditions like soil type, available water and prevailing monsoon. The principal rice ecosystems followed in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka are: 1.Wet system 2.Dry system 3.Semidry system Wet System The wet system is also known as Irrigated rice. In this system, the crop is grown under wet (irrigated) conditions from seed to seed. The field is brought to a soft puddle by repeated ploughings with 5-7 cm standing water. After obtaining a soft puddle and perfect levelling, rice seedlings are transplanted or sprouted seeds dibbled or broadcasted on the puddle field. This system of cultivation is followed wherever assured irrigation water is available. This irrigated rice contributes to 55 per cent of the total rice production System of Rice Intensification (SRI) Transplanted Puddled Lowland Rice Direct Wet Seeded Puddled Lowland Rice METHODS FOLLOWED IN WET SYSTEM ARE SYSTEM OF RICE INTENSIFICATION TRANSPLANTED PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE DIRECT WET SEEDED PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE Top System of Rice Intensification System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a methodology for increasing the productivity of irrigated rice by changing the management of plants, soil, water and nutrients particularly by eliciting greater root growth. SRI is not a technology because something still evolving and improving, season by season, as more experience is gained and as more farmers, scientists and others apply their intelligence and insights to making rice production more efficient and sustainable. Critical Steps in SRI SRI Practices Advantages and Constraints of SRI Crop Response Difference between Conventional and SRI method of cultivation Cost comparison for Conventional and SRI method of cultivation Critical steps in SRI Nursery area and Seed rate Seedling age Square planting Water management Mechanical (Cono) weeder usage Nursery area and seed rate Only 7-8 kg of seed is required to plant 1 ha. Nursery area is reduced to 100m2 / ha. For raised beds @ 1 x 5 m and 20 beds are required for 1 ha. Spread polythene sheets over the beds evenly. Fill the soil evenly over the Polythene sheets upto 4cm. Uniformly spread 375 g of seeds in each 5 sq.m. nursery bed. Watering through rose can is advisable. Cover the seed bed using locally available mulching materials like coirpith/straw Seedling age Fourteen days old seedlings were recommended for transplanting (3 leaves stage) If the nursery bed is properly prepared with sufficient organic manure, the seedling growth will be good to handle. Water Management Water management is one of the critical steps in SRI and provision of aerobic environment in rice fields is the core point in SRI. Plants with truncated roots cannot access the residual soil moisture in lower horizons that is accessible to plants which have large and functioning roots systems to maintain their growth and productivity. Hence, alternate wetting and drying is advocated. Irrigation only to moist the soil in the early period of 10 days. Restoring irrigation to a maximum depth of 2.5cm after development of hairline cracks in the soil until panicle initiation. Increasing irrigation depth to 5.0 cm after Panicle initiation one day after disappearance of ponded water. Mechanical (Cono) weeder usage Square planting eases the cono/rotary weeder operation in two directions, and thereby weed management could be effected efficiently. In SRI, weeder should be used at 10 days interval from the date of transplanting. Three labours are enough to weed one acre. Weeds are trampled and on decay the nutrient are ploughed back to the soil. Soil is frequently disturbed which has beneficial physico chemical â biological results in soil. Root pruning triggers the tillering that results in bursting out of tillers. Water level should be properly monitored for usage of weeder. It is important to remove the left out weeds by hand. By this the cost of weeding is reduced by 52.5%. Top SRI Practices The Principles of SRI are achieved by following certain practices Season Dry season with assured irrigation is more suitable. Difficulty in crop establishment may be seen in areas with heavy downpour (NE Monsoon periods of Tamil Nadu) Varieties Hybrids and varieties with heavy tillering. Seed rate 7- 8 kg / ha for single seedling per hill Nursery Management Required nursery area is 100 m2/ha (or) 2.5 cent/ha â 1cent/acre Usage of well decomposed good quality FYM judiciously. For raised beds @ 1 x 5 m and 20 beds are required for 1 ha. Powdered DAP may be applied @ 95g/raised bed in total 1.9 kg should be used. Spread polythene sheets over the beds evenly. Old polysacks can also be used. ill the soil evenly on the Polythene sheets upto 4cm. Seed treatment can be done with Pseudomonas 10g/kg seed. 75 g Azophos biofertiliser/kg seed. Uniformly spread 375 g of seeds in each 5 sq.m. nursery bed. Watering through rose can is advisable. Cover the seed bed using locally available mulching materials like coirpith/straw. Main field preparation Plough the land during summer to economize the water requirement for initial preparation of land. Flood the field 1 or 2 days before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface of the field covered with water. Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling. Good leveling (laser leveling) of the main field is essential in SRI. Field drainage is an important component in SRI. Transplanting The seedling along with the soil intact with the roots should be removed and plant them immediately. Fourteen days old seedlings were recommended for transplanting. At this stage the seedling will have 3 leaves. If the nursery bed is properly prepared with sufficient organic manure, the seedling growth will be good to handle. Plant spacing Square planting at 25 x 25cm ensures optimum space for efficient utilization of resources. Place single seedling at intersecting points marked with the marker. Place the seedling without plunging too deep into the soil. Nutirent Management Apply 12.5 t of FYM or compost or green leaf manure @ 6.25 t/ha. Organic manures addition is recommended in SRI cultivation, as they are found to supply essential nutrients, and creates favorable conditions for soil microbes being a source of carbon. Apply fertilizer nutrients as per soil test recommendations. N dose may be through Leaf Color Chart (LCC). P & K may be through Site Specific Nutrition Management. Depending on the necessity, top dress with chemical fertilizers. Water Management Water management is one of the critical steps in SRI and provision of aerobic environment in rice fields is the core point in SRI. Irrigate to 2.5 cm depth of water level after hairline crack formation up to panicle initiation and after that disappearance of ponded water. Water saving in this system is 40-50% from planting to harvest. Farmers using ground water will realize the water, time and electricity saving. Regular water application to keep soil moist but not saturated. Intermittent wetting and drying for adequate aeration during vegetative phase. Relatively frequent watering after vegetative phase. No water stagnation at any stage. Weeder Use Using weeder is of primary importance in SRI. Use simple rotary weeder between crop rows in both the directions starting from 10 days after planting About four rotary weedings at 10 to 15 days interval could be adequate till panicle initiation If necessary, one or two hand weedings may be necessary to remove weeds closer to rice plants. Top Advantages of SRI Saving in Seed requirement- Since single seedling is planted at wider spacing. Seed requirement in SRI is only 7-8 kg per hectare. This is particularly useful in the case of hybrids where seed cost is very high. Reduction in nursery area. Reduction in nursery duration. Increased tillering- 30 tillers per plant are fairly easy to achieve. Profused root growth- Greater force required to uproot SRI plants than conventional plants. Improved grain filling- Improvements in grain filling with larger panicles and higher panicle weight have been observed. Water Savings- Since the soil is kept moist only during vegetative growth phase and only minimal water is using during reproductive phase, SRI results in water savings to an extent of 35 to 40 % compared to conventional method. Less Lodging- SRI provides good growth environment for rice plants that putforth stronger tillers and extensive root growth and are more resistant to lodging. Less incidence of pests and diseases - As SRI plants are stronger, the incidence of pests and diseases is low. Reduced chemicals fertilizer- Though chemicals fertilizer increase the yield in SRI however resource poor farmers still can apply the locally available organic manures that still maintain higher yields while reducing the cost of externally purchased inputs. Increase grain Yield- Higher grain yields are associated with SRI than conventional method. Increased net returns up to 83 to 206% depending on wage rate. Reduced rodent damage in the fieid. Higher net profit. Top Constraints in the adoption of SRI Require strict water control practices Initially SRI method require more labourers Requires greater skill for transplanting Weed menace is relatively higher than conventional transplanting. As SRI is labour intensive it is not suitable for large scale production. Traditional mindset of the farmers Lack of awareness about the technology Non availability of critical implements like marker and weeders Lack of co-operation from the transplanting labourers Top Crop response Higher plant height Higher root growth. Higher tillering of even shy tillering genotypes Increase in number of productive panicles/m2 Higher number of grains /panicle Higher % of filled grains per panicle Lodging resistance Leaves remain green up to harvest Resistance to adverse effects of drought Higher nutrient use efficiency Higher biochemical activities Higher grain and straw yield. Higher out turn of milled rice.

Length of the seed bed may vary from 8 to 10m according to soil and slope of the land. Collect the puddled soil from the channel and spread on the seedbeds or drag a heavy along the channel to lower it, so that the seed bed is at a higher level. Level the surface of the seedbed, so that the water drains into the channel. Sow the sprouted seeds uniformly on the seedbed, having thin film of water in the nursery. Dry Nursery Nursery area Select 20 cents (800 m2) of land area for raising seedlings for one hectare. Seed rate 30 kg for long duration 40 kg for medium duration 60 kg for short duration varieties and 20 kg for hybrids Forming Seedbeds and sowing Dry ploughed field with fine tilth is required. Nursery area with sand and loamy soil status is more suitable for this type of nursery. Plots of 1 to 1.5 m width of beds and channels may be formed. Length may be according to the slope and soil. Raised beds are more ideal if the soil is clayey in nature. Sowing may be dry seeding. Seeds may be covered with sand and finely powdered well decomposed farm yard manure. Irrigation may be done to wet the soil to saturation. Optimum age for transplanting â 4th leaf stage This type of nursery is handy in times of delayed receipt of canal water. Main Field Preparation Land preparation - Tillage Plough the land during summer to economize the water requirement for initial preparation of land. Flood the field 1 or 2 days before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface of the field covered with water. Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling. After puddling perfect land levelling is required Manures and Basal Feritlizer application Application of organic manures : Apply 12.5 t of FYM or compost or green leaf manure @ 6.25 t/ha. If green manure is raised @ 20 kg /ha in situ, incorporate it to a depth of 15 cm using a green manure trampler or tractor. Apply 22 kg urea / ha at the time of first puddling while incorporating the stubbles of previous crop to compensate immobilization of N by the stubbles. This may be done atleast 10 days prior to planting of subsequent crop. Biofertilizer application : Mix 10 packets (2000 g)/ha of Azospirillum and 10 packets (2000g/ha)of Phosphobacteria or 20 packets (4000g/ha) of Azophos inoculants with 25 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the mixture uniformly in the main field before transplanting and Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf 1) at 2.5 kg/ha mixed with 50 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the mixture uniformly before transplanting. Application of inorganic fertilizers Apply fertilizer nutrients as per soil test recommendations. Blanket recommendation : 150:50:50 kg N:P2O5:K2O /ha. Apply 25% of recommended N and K fertilizers before transplanting. Recommended Phosphorus fertilizer may be applied as basal and incorporated. Apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate with 50kg sand just before transplanting. Top Stand Establishment Optimum age of seedlings for quick establishment Optimum age of the seedlings is 18-22 days for short, 25-30 days for medium and 35-40 days for long duration varieties. Planting seedlings in the main field Soil Medium and low fertility High fertility Duration Short Medium Long Short Medium Long Spacing (cm) 15x10 20x10 20x15 20x10 20x15 20x20 Hills / m2 66 50 33 50 33 25 Transplant 2-3 seedlings/hill for short duration and 2 seedlings/hill for medium and long duration varieties Shallow planting (3 cm) ensures quick establishment and more tillers. Deeper planting (> 5cm) leads to delayed establishment and reduced tillers. Line planting permits rotary weeding and its associated benefits. Allow a minimum row spacing of 20 cm to use rotary weeder. Fill up the gaps between 7th and 10th DAT. Water Management Puddling and leveling minimizes the water requirement. At the time of transplanting, a shallow depth of 2cm of water is adequate since high depth of water will lead to deep planting resulting in reduction of tillering. Maintain 2 cm of water up to seven days of transplanting. After the establishment stage, cyclic submergence of water is the best practice for rice crop. This cyclic 5cm submergence has to be continued throughout the crop period. Critical stages of water requirement in rice are a) panicle initiation, b)booting, c)heading and d) flowering. During these stages, the irrigation interval should not exceed the stipulated time so as to cause the depletion of moisture below the saturation level. During booting and maturity stages continuous inundation of 5cm and above leads to advancement in root decay and leaf senescence, delay in heading and reduction in the number of filled grains per panicle and poor harvest index. Provide adequate drainage facilities to drain excess water or strictly follow irrigation schedule of one day after disappearance of ponded. Last irrigation may be 15 days ahead of harvest. Top Direct Wet Seeded Puddled Lowland Rice Area and Field Preparation Area Direct wet seeding can be followed in all the areas wherein transplanting is in vogue. Field preparation On receipt of showers during the months of May - July repeated ploughing should be carried out so as to conserve the moisture, destroy the weeds and break the clods. Flood the field 1 or 2 days before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface of the field covered with water. Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling. More care should be taken to level the field to zero level. Varieites All the varieties recommended for transplanting can do well under direct wet seeded conditions also. However, the following varieties are more suited. Varieties Duration (Days) Time of Sowing Ponmani 160 to 165 1st to 30th August Co 43, IR20, ADT 38 ADT 39, Ponni, Improved White Ponni 125 to135 1st to 30th September ADT 36, ADT 37 105 to 110 1st to 10th October Manures and Basal Fertilizer application Application of organic manures Apply 12.5 t of FYM or compost or green leaf manure @ 6.25 t/ha. If green manure is raised @ 20 kg /ha in situ, incorporate it to a depth of 15 cm using a green manure trampler or tractor. Stubble incorporation Apply 22 kg urea / ha at the time of first puddling while incorporating the stubbles of previous crop to compensate immobilization of N by the stubbles. This may be done atleast 10 days prior to planting of subsequent crop. Biofertilizer application Mix 10 packets (2000 g)/ha of Azospirillum and 10 packets (2000g/ha)of Phosphobacteria or 20 packets (4000g/ha) of Azophos inoculants with 25 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the mixture uniformly in the main field before transplanting and Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf 1) at 2.5 kg/ha mixed with 50 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the mixture uniformly before transplanting. Application of inorganic fertilizers Apply fertilizer nutrients as per soil test recommendations. Blanket recommendation : 50:25:25 kg N:P2O5:K2O/ha. Apply 25% of recommended N and K fertilizers before transplanting. Recommended Phosphorus fertilizer may be applied as basal and incorporated. Apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate with 50kg sand just before transplanting. Sowing Follow a seed rate of 60 kg / ha Pre-germinate the seeds Sow the sprouted seeds by drum seeder or broadcast uniformly with thin film of water. Dual cropping of rice-green manure is economic for nutrient budget and efficient for grain production. For this method use âTNAU Rice-Green manure seederâ. After cultivation: Thinning and gap filling should be done 14 - 21 days after sowing, taking advantage of the immediate rain. If dual cropped with green manure, incorporate the green manure when grown to 40cm height or at 30 days after sowing, whichever is earlier, using Cono-weeder. Green manure incorporated fields may be operated again with rotary weeder a week later in order to aerate the soil and to exploit organic acids formed if any. Water Management During first one week just wet the soil by thin film of water. Depth of irrigation may be increased to 2.5cm progressively along the crop age. Provide adequate drainage facilities to drain excess water or strictly follow irrigation schedule of one day after disappearance of ponded water. Last irrigation may be 15 days ahead of harvest. Top Dry System In this system the fields are ploughed and harrowed in summer for achieving the required tilth. The seed is sown directly with the onset of the monsoon showers, either by broadcasting, dibbling behind the country plough or by drilling in lines. Line-sowing is preferable, as it ensures an adequate stand establishment and facilitates easy weeding and interculture. Dry seeded rainfed unpuddled lowland rice Rainfed upland rice Dry Seeded Rainfed un-puddled Low Land Field Preparation Whenever possible give one or two summer ploughings to minimize weed growth Dry plough to get fine tilth taking advantage of rains and soil moisture availability. Perfect land leveling for efficient weed and water management. Ensure deep tillage and fine tilth at the time of final land preparation for sowing. Provide shallow trenches (15 cm width) at an interval of 3m all along the field to facilitate draining excess water at the early growth stage. Varieites Short duration varieties are more suitable Manures and Basal fertilizer application Blanket recommendation : 50:25:25 kg N:P2O5:K2O /ha Apply a basal dose of 750 kg of FYM enriched with fertilizer phosphorus (P at 25 kg/ha) Basal application of FeSO4 at 50 kg/ha is desirable for iron deficient soil. Seed Rate and Sowing Seed rate: 75kg/ha dry seed for any recommended variety. Seed hardening with 1% KCl for 16 hours (seed and KCl solution 1:1) and shade dried to bring to storable moisture. This will enable the crop to withstand early moisture stress. On the day of sowing, treat the hardened seeds first with Pseudomonas fluorescens 10g/kg of seed and then with Azophos 2000g or Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria @ 600g each per ha seed, whichever is available. Broadcasting: The seeds are sown by broadcasting when the moisture is at the marginal level and the surface soil is compacted by a light roller for compacting the seeds with moist soil. Line sowing: Sowing /dibbling behind the country plough. Line sowing is better than broadcasting. Using seed drill to ensure optimum population, reduce the seed rate and for early intercultivation. Drill sow with 20 cm inter row spacing using seed drill. The seeds can also be sown behind the country plough Depth of sowing should be 3 - 5 cm and the top soil can be made compact with leveling board. Pre-monsoon sowing is advocated for uniform germination. After Cultivation Azospirillum inoculants 10 packets (2000g/ha) and Phosphobacteria 10 packets (2000g/ha) or 20 packets (4000g/ha) of Azophos mixed with 25 kg of FYM may be broadcasted uniformly over the field just after the receipt soaking rain / moisture. Thinning and gap filling should be done 14 - 21days after sowing, taking advantage of the immediate rain Spray Cycocel 1000 ppm (1 ml of commercial product in one lit. of water) under water deficit situations to mitigate ill-effects. Foliar spray of Kaolin 3% (30 ml in 1 lit. of water) or KCl 1% (10 ml in 1 lit. of water) to overcome moisture stress at different physiological stages of rice. Weed Management First weeding can be done between 15 and 21 days after germination. Second weeding may be done 30 - 45 days after first weeding. Apply pendimethalin 1.0 kg/ha on 5 days after sowing or Pretilachlor + safener (Sofit) 0.45kg/ha on the day of receipt of soaking rain followed by one hand weeding on 30 to 35 days after sowing. Top Rainfed Upland Rice Field Preparation The success of the direct seeded rice depends entirely on the monsoon rains,besides proper stand of crop. If sowing is done in a properly prepared land, proper stand of crop can be achieved. A field with fine tilth facilitates the seed to come in contact with the soil moisture after drilling and enables the seed to germinate quickly and uniformly. Thus, an ideal preparation of the land will help to achieve a uniform stand, facilitate weeding and fertilizer practices. Varieties Short duration varieties like PTB 28, PTB 29, PTB 30 Manures and Basal fertilizer application In Tamil Nadu, P is applied at 25 kg/ha as enriched FYM at the time of last ploughing.N at 50 kg/ha and K at 25 kg/ha should be applied in two splits viz.20 to 25 DAS and the second at 40 to 45 DAS. In kerala, For modan cultivation (upland crop) Apply the full dose of P2O5 (20 kg/ha) at the time of land preparation as basal dressing and apply nitrogen (40 kg/ha) in three equal split doses, first as basal dressing, second at tillering stage (three weeks after seeding) and the third at panicle initiation stage (about thirty days before flowering). Apply K2O (30 kg/ha) either in a single dose as basal or in two split doses half basal and half at the panicle initiation stage. Seed Rate and Sowing Seed rate â 80-100 kg/ha Broadcasting: The seeds are sown by broadcasting when the moisture is at the marginal level and the surface soil is compacted by a light roller for compacting the seeds with moist soil. Line sowing: Sowing /dibbling behind the country plough. Line sowing is better than broadcasting. Using seed drill to ensure optimum population, reduce the seed rate and for early intercultivation. Weed Management Under upland condition, weeds reduce the yield to the extent of 50 %. First weeding should be done at 15 to 20 DAS and second weeding may be done on 45 DAS. Under unfavourable rainfall conditions, application of Thiobencarb 2.5l/ha or Pendimethalin 3.0 l/ha 8 DAS as sand mix if adequate moisture is available followed by one hand weeding on 30 to 35 DAS. Top Semidry System In this system seeds are sown in ploughed dry soil with monsoon rains. Whenever water is available after onset of monsoon, it is treated as wet paddy. In command area, anticipating the release of water, rice crop can be raised under semi dry condition up to a maximum of 45 days. Then the crop in converted in the wet condition on receipt of water. Dry seeded rice in unpuddled lowland Dry seeded rice in unpuddled lowland Area and Field Preparation Area - Chengleput, Ramnad, Kanyakumari and Pudukottai district in TamilNadu. Field preparation Dry plough to get fine tilth taking advantage of rains and soil moisture availability. Apply gypsum at 1 t/ha basally wherever soil crusting and soil hardening problem exist.Perfect land leveling for efficient weed and water management. Provide shallow trenches (15 cm width) at an interval of 3m all along the field to facilitate draining excess water at the early growth stage. Manures and Basal fertilizer application Blanket recommendation: 75:25:37.5 kg N:P2O5:K2O/ha Apply a basal dose of 750 kg of FYM enriched with fertilizer phosphorus (P at 25 kg/ha). Apply N and K in three splits at 20-25, 40-45 and 60-65 days after germination. Each split may follow 25 kg N and 12.5 kg K20. Basal application of ZnSO4 at 25kg/ha and FeSO4 at 50 kg/ha is desirable wherever Zinc and iron deficiency were noted. Seed Rate and Sowing Seed rate: 75kg/ha dry seed for any recommended variety. Seed hardening with 1% KCl for 16 hours (seed and KCl solution 1:1) and shade dried to bring to storable moisture. This will enable the crop to withstand early moisture stress. On the day of sowing, treat the hardened seeds first with Pseudomonas fluorescens 10g/kg of seed and then with Azophos 2000g or Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria @ 600g each per ha seed, whichever is available. Drill sow with 20 cm inter row spacing using seed drill. The seeds can also be sown behind the country plough Depth of sowing should be 3 - 5 cm and the top soil can be made compact with leveling board. Pre-monsoon sowing is advocated for uniform germination. Pre-monsoon sowing with medium duration variety is an advantage for higher grain yield and as well to manage the heavy rainy season. Weed Management First weeding should be done between 15 and 21 days after germination. Second weeding may be done 30 - 45 days after first weeding. Apply pendimethalin 1.0kg/ha on 5 days after sowing or Pretilachlor + safener (Sofit) 0.45kg/ha on the day of receipt of soaking rain followed by one hand weeding on 30 to 35 days after sowing. Water Management The crop is irrigated from 30-35 days onwards, utilizing water impounded in the tanks or canal. Irrigation may be to a depth of 2.5-5.0cm only. Follow the schedule of one day after disappearance of ponded water in order to save water and to bring additional this type of rice cultivation. Top Hybrid seed production The success and sustenance of hybrid rice technology depends on the efficient and economic hybrid seed production, so as to provide good quality seed at reasonable price to the farmers. Hybrid seed production, in self pollinated crop like rice, is quite tedious. Therefore, extensive trials were conducted to standardize the seed production package. Various requirements for successful seed production such as ideal locations/seasons, seed rate, row ratio, GA3, supplementary pollination techniques etc., have been worked out and a seed production package has been developed. The details of the package are as under. Optimum package for hybrid rice seed production and CMS multiplication Activity Particulars Seed rate : Seed parent 15 kg/ha Pollen parent 5 kg/ha Nursery : Sparse seeding to ensure multitillered (4-5) seedlings in 25 days Row ratio : 2B:10A, for CMS multiplication 2R:12A, for hybrid seed production Number of seedlings/hill : 2 seedlings/hill for seed parent and 3 seedlings/hill for pollen parent Spacing : B/R to B/R - 30 cm B/R to A - 20 cm A to A - 15 cm GA3 application : 45 g/ha at 5% heading in two split doses on consecutive days Supplementary pollination : Twice a day at peak anthesis during flowering phase Roguing : Twice during vegetative phase based on morphological characters and twice during and after flowering based on floral characters sterility etc. Seed yield (t/ha) : 1.0-1.5 Land selection: The selected land should not have been cultivated with the same variety in the previous season and the land should be free from volunteer plants. The land should have good drainage facilities, sunshine and wind flow. Since cross pollination has to take place through wind, adequate wind flow is required. Sowing Season: Kharif - (May- June sowing) Rabi - (December- January sowing) December â January sowing is most favourable for getting quality seeds. Pre Sowing Seed Treatment: Dormancy breaking treatment: Seeds are soaked in KNo3 0.5% for 16 hrs. Seed hardening treatments: Paddy seeds are soaked in 1%KCL solution for 10 hours in 1:1 ratio. Then they dried back to the original moisture content then the seed are treated with captan / thiram @ 4g/kg and also with azospirillum / azotobacter @ 3 pockets / acre seeds. Nursery: For a nursery of 40m2, apply 2 kg of DAP and sow male and female seeds at 1 kg / 40 m2 (1 cent) sparsely in separate nurseries. Because of DAP application and sparse sowing, vigorous seedlings can be obtained within 20 days. Row Ratio : The optimum age of seedlings for transplanting in the main field is 18-21 days. Use 2-3 seedlings per hill for transplanting of male seedlings. One well developed seedling with 2-3 tillers is preferred for planting of female line. The female and male seedlings are transplanted at 8:2 ratio simultaneously in the main field. Row ratio and spacing of A and R lines in the main field Female and male seedlings have to be planted by adopting the following spacing. Spacing : Female x Female - 10Ã15 cm Female x Male - 20 cm Male x Male - 30 Ã 15cm Roguing : In the male and female rows, roguing is essential from the initial stage.Rogueing should be done based on the plant height, flowering behaviour, flower colour and pollen colour. In the female rows, rogue out all the pollen shedders. Normally, in the female parent 40-50 per cent of seed set is possible. If there is a plant with more than 75 per cent seed set, that may be a pollen shedder or off-type, which has to be immediately rogued out. Supplementary pollination : Rope pulling or rod driving for 10 days from 20% flowering is done at 10-12 noon and 3-4 p.m. for one week to facilitate pollen dispersal and effective pollination. Application of Gibberellin : GA3 is one of the essential requirements for hybrid seed production and it is a costly input. Therefore, efforts are being made to find some alternate chemicals or substitutes to economize GA3 use. Initial results have indicated that GA3 requirement can be reduced by using some chemicals such as ZnSO4, urea and boric acid in combination with lower doses of GA3.Such studies will help to reduce the cost of seed production thus helping the farmers to get the hybrid seed at reasonable cost which is now being sold @ Rs. 90-100/kg. Advantages of GA3 application : Enhances panicle and stigma exertion, Adjusts plant height of seed and pollen parents, Speed up the growth of late tillers and increases the effective tillers. Sets uniform panicle layer, Flag leaf angle is increased, Increases 1000 grain weight, Reduced unfilled grains, Remarkably enhances seed setting and seed yield. Synchronisation of flowering : The optimum standard of synchronization flowering is that the female parent should be 2 days earlier than the male parent.If the differences in the predicted flowering date is more than 3 days between the parental lines, then adjustment is needed. If the flowering is to be delayed in female line, spray 2% urea (2g in 100ml of water) solution with knapsack sprayer on male parent to induce vegetative growth. If the flowering is to be hastened, apply 1% Di Ammonium Phosphate solution to induce flowering. If the male male parent is late in flowering, it can be advanced by increasing the water level in the field. Draining the water will delay the flowering. Harvesting : At fully mature stage, harvest the male parent first and remove from the field and then harvest the hybrid seed in female parent. Threshing and drying : Hybrid seeds are very delicate in nature and so are highly vulnerable to mechanical injury. Manual threshing when the seed moisture is between 15 and 18 per cent will minimize mechanical injury. Hybrid seeds can be threshed using mechanical thresher with careful adjustments to reduce injury. The seeds can be dried to 12 per cent moisture for safe storage. Seed yield : Seed producers can obtain seed yields of about 1.0 to 1.5 t/ha by adopting this package. There is a need to refine the present technology so as to enhance the seed yields up to 2.0 to 2.5 t/ha so that the seed cost can be reduced. Seed production in varieties Land requirement : The selected land should not have been cultivated with same variety in the previous season and the land should be free from volunteer plants. Isolation distance : Rice is mainly a self pollinated crop. For pure seed production, the seed fields must be isolated at least by 3 meters from rice fields of other varieties. Season : Varieties Suitable Season Short duration (105-110 days) November-December Mediumduration (110-125 days) November Long duration(125-145 days) August Seed rate: Short duration - 60 kg/ha Medium duration - 40 kg/ha Long duration - 30 kg/ha Upgradation of seed quality using salt solution : The density of stored seed diminishes during storage period, place, environment and pest and diseases. Aged seeds like used battery cells will loose vigour in due course of time. Using salt solution, good quality, denser and vigorous seeds can be separated. Seed treatment : Seeds treated with a fungicide like bavistin or captan @ 2g/kg and kept overnight before sowing in the nursery. Nursery : Good management of the nursery will result in vigorous seedlings and also in controlling the occurrence of offtypes in the seed crop. The land on which rice nursery or rice crop was not grown in the previous season should be selected to prevent offtypes. If the previous crop was rice, then the nursery plot should be flooded with water to trigger germination of buried seeds and such germinated seedlings can be destroyed by ploughing the field after one week. Fertile soil with adequate drainage is essential for good nursery. Nursery sowing: For sowing 50 kg of seeds required for one ha, a nursery area of 800 m2 is required. The soil of nursery should be well pulverized by 2-4 ploughings and during last ploughing one tonne of farm yard manure should be applied. Nursery beds of 40m2 area are prepared. Seeds are pre-germinated before sowing. For pregermination, the seeds are soaked in water for 12 hours and soaked seeds are loosely packed in gunny bag and then placed in darkness for 24 hours for sprouting. During the pregermination process, radicles would have protruded out of the seeds. The water used for soaking should be pure. Already used water should not be used for soaking to avoid the spread of diseases through seeds. Age of seedlings: Age of seedlings plays an important role in the growth of crop. A too young or too old seedling leads to reduction of yield. Based on the duration of the varieties, the age of seedlings suitable for transplantation varies. Varieties Age of seedlings Short duration 13-22 days Medium duration 25-30 days Long duration 35-40 days Preparation of main field for transplanting : Spread 25 tonnes of FYM on the field which selected for seed production. Then the field is irrigated and the land is ploughed 2 or 3 times and puddled. Before last puddling, urea, super phosphate and Murate of Potast are applied basally as per the following table: Basal application of fertilizers in different varieties Varieties Urea (Kg) Super phosphate (Kg) MOP (Kg) Short duration 50 125 20 Medium duration 50 125 30 Long duration 50 125 40 For zinc deficient fields, basal application of zinc sulphate @ 30 kg/ha is recommended. After last ploughing, the fields are well levelled. Spacing for different rice varieties : Varieties Spacing (cm) Short duration 20Ã10 Medium duration 20Ã15 Long duration 20Ã20 In the main field, after each 8 feet, a gap of one foot is to be left which is required for easy rouging. This is called rouging space. Water management : Water level upto a height of 2 cm should be maintained for a period of one week after transplantation. On 30th day, water should be drained off completely for one or two days. This enables aeration in soil and increases root growth. During tillering stage a water level of 5 cm should be maintained. During booting, flowering and milking stages, water stress should be avoided. During maturity stage, 15 days before harvest, water is drained off completely from the field. Weed Control: Within three days after transplantation, herbicide butachlor @ 2.5 lit ha-1 mixed with 20 kg sand should be applied to the field. Use of rotary weeder from 15 DAT at 10 days interval. After 30-35 days, a hand weeding is essential. Fertilizer application: After first weeding and during flowering stage, urea is applied and during milky stage, muriate of potash is applied. The dosage of fertilizer depends upon the duration of the crop. Rouging: Normally in rice fields, non-uniform height and differences in flowering among plant population is observed. The crop of the same variety cannot show such variations and so this shows the contamination of the seed field with some other varieties which affect the genetic purity of the seed crop. Also, certain weeds grow along with the crop seeds. Similarly some field fungi cause seed infection in the field itself. The off-type plants, weeds and diseased plants should be rogued out at appropriate stage preferably before flowering. By this, genetic purity of the seeds can be maintained. Stage of crop Rogues to be removed Before flowering Very tall or short plants, early flowering plants. Flowering stage Late flowering plants, chaffy grains Pre-harvest stage Awned grains Harvest stage Based on seed size, shape and colour Foliar application: Spraying 2 per cent DAP results in higher seed yield with good quality. Depending upon the duration of the crop, the stage for DAP spray also varies. Appropriate stage for harvesting: Harvesting of seed crop at correct stage is essential. Otherwise, seed yield will be greatly reduced. If the seeds are harvested at premature stage, the seeds get shrunk (during drying), thereby reducing the germination capacity. Delayed harvest results in discoloration of seeds besides inviting pest and disease incidence.During maturity stage, 90 per cent of seeds would have acquired straw colour and seed moisture content will be 17-20 per cent. Threshing without mechanical injuries: The seed moisture content should be 15 to 18 per cent during threshing. If the seed moisture content is more or less than this level, the chances of mechanical injuries are more. These invisible injuries will reduce seed viability and increase disease incidence on the seeds. Seed drying: Threshed seeds should be dried immediately in a systematic manner. Otherwise deterioration due to high respiration rate may occur. If the seeds are heaped without drying, temperature of the seeds may increase. Optimum time for drying the seeds under sun is 8.00 am to 12.00 noon and 3.00p.m. to 5.00p.m. Drying of seeds during 12.00 noon to 3.00p.m. should be avoided as the incidence of UV rays from the sun is more besides temperature being high during this time. Continuous drying of seeds from morning to evening under sun should be avoided. The seeds should be spread evenly every day after sun drying allowing free aeration otherwise, heating will occur resulting in lowering of seed quality. Copyright Â© TNAU | All Rights Reserved
